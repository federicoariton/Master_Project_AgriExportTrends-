farming,Barley,Can you make silage or pellets from hydroponics barley fodder,"
I'm new to farming & currently growing barley fodder in a hydroponic system, harvesting it after 8 days of growth. While it provides great fresh feed for my livestock, I‚Äôm looking for ways to store the excess fodder long-term without losing its nutritional value. I‚Äôm considering making silage or possibly converting it into pellets, but I‚Äôm unsure of the process and whether it will retain the same quality.

Has anyone tried this with their hydroponic barley fodder? What‚Äôs been your experience? Are there other methods for storing it effectively? I‚Äôd love to hear about your storage techniques, any challenges you faced, and the best ways to preserve fodder for future use.

I'm curious if anybody has any comments and experience regarding using sprouted grains (we're looking at barley) to offset part of the grain ration.

The farm would be at least 50km away from other grain farms and at least 120km from closest selling place. Some fields are smaller size and a few up to 100/120 acres. Ground has never seen chemicals as it was all used as pasture only in the past. I'm working with agronomist to test the soil so I don't have results yet. Lots has to be done, no bins, shelter, it's far, I have access to some capital and financing.

the rain is literally destroying us we farm 550 acres of oats barley and OSR and we only have 100 acres of oats in and about 50 acres of barley in with the rest of the farm not been ploughed because its literally not stopped raining for the past 6 months and now its april we are beggining to stress if we wont get much of a crop in this year. we have a cultivator on demo very soon as we have just given up on the plough as its to wet and to much time to use. we use our barley and oats to feed our cattle along with straw which is why we need mainly just more barley in. and god i have respect for bigger farmers who have even more work to do and are probarly more stressed then we are

farming,Wheat,Crop deaths regarding beans and wheat,"Hi, if you guys could help me, I wanted to know more about crop deaths and what better than to directly ask farmers that are in the field using all these machines, combines and what not, and since I read this thread already https://old.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/gqkitr/how_many_animals_do_combines_kill/, and read something on the subject already, I wanted to ask something more specific, as in, talking about legumes, but more specifically crops like pinto beans and black-eyed peas, in the stages of production, tilling, planting and specially harvest, for any of you who farm these legumes, do all these machines, especially combines, kill too many animals? Of all kinds, big ones, rats, even things like grasshoppers. Maybe it's not as much as wheat for example, because it's not as tall, but maybe I'm wrong. Actually extend that question to wheat too, so any beans and wheat farmer that want to share their input, I would be glad!

But also it would be important to keep in context, as in, ok maybe a good number of animals die, but how much is being harvested? How many acres per day in comparison to the field animals dying, or better yet, how many tons of beans and what not.
For example, in this other thread I saw that this Claas 770 Lexion and saw on wikipedia that they can harvest 40 tons of grains per hour, this is quite impressive for me that knows little about the subject. So in comparison to what they harvest, the animal deaths might be minimal.

Also I would think that animals would just run away from a big and noisy machine like a combine, but maybe I'm wrong.

Also animal density depending on the area of the world might be different and that might affect it too, so there's that.

If someone could share their experience, I would be glad. If rambled on a bit, I apologize. Thanks!",1,1732017348.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1guvfm9/crop_deaths_regarding_beans_and_wheat/

There were several reasons for planting in this timeframe, one of them having to do with frost tenderness, the other having to do with pests. (Wheat varieties-Catawba Red Winter Wheat, Appalachian White Hard Winter) 

Should I plant within that timeframe even if it pushes back the planting time a month or should I plant significantly before the first frost and deal with the consequences?

farming,Wheat,SxS wheat harvestin',"I survey land, sometimes I survey old farm plots with wheat that is grown from last year's (I assume) droppings. I usually survey with a Side by Side UTV that gathers a few handfuls of heads of grain as I drive about.

Question is, is there any reason why I can't just mill this into flour? 

I've collected about a half big mason jar worth of hand thrushed wheat this year. These farm plots when I survey them are about 2 weeks away from being graded into a subdivision. So I wouldn't necessarily consider it stealing if it's going to be in someone's backyard. 

I like to reuse what I can, I'd almost consider something to help me harvest it if it can go on my side by side. I I'm not knowledgeable in grain; so I figured I'd ask the experts.

farming,Milk,Family Injured Milking ,"Well this week has been a challenge for my extended family. My oldest cousin, partner in their farm, had cancer surgery this past Tuesday. Thankfully, he‚Äôs doing remarkably well. Before he went in, he and my youngest cousin, second farm partner, hammered in their corn, filled two haylage ground bags, and baled some bedding bales up. They also go their fertilizer on and tillage done. They busted their humps. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my second oldest cousin has been helping to milk for the past few years. Yesterday morning, one of the switch cows ended up wanting to back into the gutter while she was being milked. That took my cousin right under the cow and trapped her, twisted her backwards into a new switch cow. The new cow spooked bad and ended up managing to get a hoove right down my cousin‚Äôs left bicep - splitting her wide open. 

My youngest cousin managed to get her free, used baling twine to make a tourniquet, and got her to the local hospital. The local hospital ended up sending her down to the big city - same hospital my other cousin is in for the surgery. 

My aunt - who God bless her - is in her early eighties, still tends the calves twice a day, is fit to be tied. I made arrangements to head up to our place early this morning to be there at the farm for the afternoon work and evening milking. My aunt catches me and tells me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you milking.‚Äù  Well - my aunt means well and she doesn‚Äôt realize that I just retired from a career where people shoot at us and we get hurt doing our duties. I also had some higher risk specialty assignments as well thru my career. So when it came time to start milking, I kinda just started to hang milkers and pitched in. I did kinda end up just doing post dipping bc of the rhythm of the barn this evening. 

My aunt was like - cows can hurt you and they‚Äôre unpredictable. Yep-I agree. BUT they don‚Äôt milk themselves and sometimes you just have to take it and do it. 

Not sure where I‚Äôm going with all this but things happen on a farm. Thankfully my cousins remained calm and one knew enough to stop the bleeding. She ultimately is gonna be hurting for a while. 

Just take care of family. ",37,1718414931.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1dg6oza/family_injured_milking/

farming,Milk,I never wanted to farm.,"I never wanted to farm. Growing up we were always a source of labor for my dad and I always struggled. I hate milking cows, fucking hate it, and my dad and I fought (explosivly) for years.

Fast forward to otober 2019 and my dad is laid up with open heart surgery and I was having trouble finding a job so we decided I'd help out while he recovered. Then covington happened. And I thought. ""Well, the farm is a good place to ride that out."" And i did. He recovered and we kept farming.

Then the hired man left and I became the #1 hired help. I was working seven days a week for almost a year and I was tired. They relented and now I get one day off a week (unless we're busy, then I dont). My old man treats my days off like an inconvenience for him and doesn't respect my time or space.

We have an old neighbor helping out now (which is the only reason I get a day off), but he's kinda.. well, dopey, and dad doesn't really like only having him.

I feel like I've been burnt out for years now. I have no friends here, no social life, no motivation, and when I do have days off I just sleep. My old man is pretty hard to work with, none of his kids want to take over the farm. He shoots down any other idea for the farm, like transitioning to beef or produce, because dairy makes money. I want to leave. But I know if the farm goes down it'll be ""my fault.""
I know what I need to do, but doing it is gonna be... rough.

I pay them the same amount per hour because the second guy works 7 days a week and is supposed to help me with field work and other odd jobs. He has since stopped doing any outside work and is only milking cows. He says he is worth more when doing odd jobs because he has experience with electrical and construction type jobs and he can make more doing the same type of stuff somewhere else.

farming,Milk,"South Africa‚Äôs ‚ÄòToo White‚Äô Farms May Lose EU, UK Access","South African farms deemed ‚Äútoo white‚Äù will no longer be able to export their produce to the UK and the EU, according to postings in the Government Gazette, the Johannesburg-based City Press newspaper reported.

Under the rules, farmers must meet specific Black economic empowerment targets to continuing obtaining export permits.

The guidelines will apply to agricultural businesses with a minimum annual turnover of 10 million rand ($534,000) or more. Milk, cream, butter, fruit, nuts, sugar, jam, fruit pur√©e, fruit juices, yeast, table grapes and wine are among the products affected, according to the notice.

Southern African Agri Initiative (SAAI), a farmers‚Äô lobbying group, told City Press that the rules will undermine investor security, job creation and growth in the nation‚Äôs agricultural sector.

Further, the measures fall ‚Äúfar outside the framework of internationally acceptable protocols, and the lobby will fight against it in every local and international forum, in courts and multilateral agencies of the UN and the African Union,‚Äù City Press reported, citing Theo de Jager, head of SAAI.

Democratic Alliance, the biggest opposition party in South Africa, lodged a complaint with the trade offices of the EU and the UK, arguing that the regulations violate the rules of fair trade. South Africa‚Äôs agreements with the EU and the UK are explicitly premised upon protecting human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, the alliance said.

South African agricultural exports were about 240 billion rand ($12.8 billion) in 2022, with 20% headed to the EU and 4% to the UK.

South African companies have been encouraged to adopt Black-empowerment plans to comply with government policies aimed at redressing financial inequality stemming from the apartheid era.",350,1699835229.0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-12/south-africa-s-too-white-farms-lose-eu-uk-access-city-press

farming,Milk,"The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has drafted new rules for regulating raw milk. This announcement, made on July 14, came without any prior warning, and with very little time provided for public input.","Promoting common-sense policies for diversified food systems

The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has drafted new rules for regulating raw milk. This announcement, made on July 14, came without any prior warning, and with very little time provided for public input. The deadline to submit comments on the draft rules is tomorrow, Tuesday, July 28.

¬†

This is only a first step in the rulemaking process and there will be more opportunities for public comment as the process moves forward ‚Äì but it‚Äôs important to speak up early.¬†We have done a detailed analysis of the draft rules, and we‚Äôre asking you to¬†support our suggested changes¬†or submit your own comments if you have additional or different concerns.

¬†

The draft rules are complicated and contain multiple confusing provisions.¬†After a close look, we have several major concerns.

¬†

¬†

1. Requirement that farmers provide DSHS with customer lists

¬†

The draft rules require raw milk farmers to provide the agency with a customer list that includes the amount and types of products sold to each customer. Not only does this impose an undue burden on the farmer, but it is an unacceptable intrusion into consumer privacy.¬†People shouldn‚Äôt have their names and buying habits handed over to the government simply because they want to drink raw milk!

¬†

¬†

2. Definition of the word ‚Äúsale‚Äù

¬†

The rules require a Grade A permit to sell raw milk ‚Ä¶ an apparently common-sense provision¬†that has proven to be surprisingly confusing due to the breadth of the regulatory definition of¬†‚Äúsale.‚Äù But while the current definition is flawed and should be changed, the draft definition is even more problematic.¬†The draft definition is so confusing and ambiguous,¬†we can‚Äôt say for certain how it would apply ‚Äì which is itself a problem. And it appears to be a back-door approach to classifying herdshare agreements and/or buyers‚Äô groups as illegal ‚Äúsales.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Why, for example, does the rule define ‚Äúsale‚Äù as the ‚Äúacquisition‚Äù of milk when the traditional definition relates to an action by the¬†seller, not the¬†purchaser?¬†Similarly, the use of the word ‚Äúconveyance‚Äù in the definition implies that anyone ‚Äúconveying‚Äù a gallon of milk in their car for a friend could be considered making a ‚Äúsale.‚Äù And in one subsection, ‚Äúsale‚Äù is defined as including ‚Äúthe transfer or acquisition of milk through a contribution system,‚Äù which has no legal definition but would seem to be aimed at herdshares and buyers‚Äô clubs.

¬†

¬†

3. Provisions for home delivery

¬†

While we were initially encouraged to see that the draft rule included a provision to allow farmers to deliver raw milk, it is limited to DSHS‚Äô ‚Äúretail foods jurisdictions,‚Äù which generally include only rural areas. Anywhere there is a local health department, which includes every significant urban center, would be excluded. So, under the draft rule, raw milk farmers still would not be allowed to deliver to the vast majority of Texans.

¬†

To make things more difficult, there‚Äôs no online resource that indicates which areas are under local health department jurisdiction vs. DSHS jurisdiction. So, a farmer would have to call local health departments to determine if a customer‚Äôs address is within DSHS jurisdiction or not.

¬†

¬†

4. Additional concerns

¬†

Our comments to DSHS also address these issues:

The draft rule adds a prohibition on freezing raw milk.¬†We know of no health or safety reason for this ban.

Addition of a warning label.¬†In the past, we supported the same language as being proposed, but we asked that it be included¬†IFsales were to be allowed at farmers‚Äô markets. The label is unnecessary for sales that occur on-farm, since customers are knowingly seeking out raw milk.

Inspection frequency.¬†The draft rules move away from the current frequency set for inspections and testing, proposing ‚Äúa frequency determined by the department.‚Äù This leaves the door open for either extremely infrequent¬†or¬†extremely frequent inspections, both of which are problematic.

Banning raw butter.¬†The draft rule excludes raw butter from the allowed raw milk products. Within our comments to DSHS, we provide data on raw butter‚Äôs excellent track record for¬†safety (drawn from the¬†Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund‚Äôs petition¬†to the FDA to legalize the interstate shipment of raw milk butter).

¬†

5. Missed opportunities for improvements

¬†

FARFA‚Äôs comments also point out several areas where there have been problems under the current regulations, which could be fixed during this rulemaking process:

Exempting micro-dairies from the extensive permitting requirements.

Allowing sales at farmers‚Äô markets.

Setting out procedures to ensure that inspectors properly handle raw milk samples, so that farmers aren‚Äôt unfairly penalized.

Raising the allowable coliform (harmless bacteria) counts.

¬†

TAKE ACTION

You can read the draft rules¬†on DSHS‚Äôs website¬†(scroll down to the Draft Rules Informal Comments section).¬†Please take a few minutes to read¬†the full text of our comments.¬†We encourage you to email comments before the deadline tomorrow, and either write your own comments with your major concerns or simply state that you support the comments submitted by Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance.

¬†

To be considered by the agency, comments must ¬†be emailed to¬†milk.regulatory@dshs.texas.gov.¬†

¬†

Please also send a copy to¬†Info@FarmAndRanchFreedom.org, so we have a record of everyone‚Äôs comments.

¬†

Again, this is just the beginning of the formal rulemaking process.¬†The Department will provide additional, and more extended, periods for public comment at different stages of the process. We‚Äôll keep you informed about those opportunities and about any changes to the content of the proposed rule as they arise.

¬†

Thank you for taking action!

farming,Hen eggs,Dog Depredation - Poultry Farm - Pastured Raised model w/ secured shelters,"My family and I raise \~1200 poultry annually - that number is a mixture of laying hens for eggs and broilers raised on pasture and feed in mobile chicken shelters secured with hardware cloth, and 2x4 welded wire fence.

While feeding today we found one of our market-weight (\~10lbs live weight each, which after processing sells for \~$40 each) broiler shelters with several injured, and dead broilers in it.  There was a dog running around the outside of it, running the birds around, and then climbing up top trying to stick its paws in to swipe at the broilers.

Several of them were dead at this point but many others were still alive, although their wings had been ripped entirely or ripped partially off their bodies so they had to be culled.

After attempting to scare the dog off, yell at it, and make a bunch of noise to spook it, it refused to leave and was still in full predator mode.  We wound up having to shoot it to stop the damage.

The losses are 8 broilers killed outright and \~15 culls whose wings were ripped off for a loss of 23 market-weight birds @ a loss of \~$1000.

I've taken a fair bit of troublesome raccoons over the years, and lose 1 or 2 broilers here or there, but this is my first dog I've had to depredate.  20+ broilers in one attack is quite a bit.

Any thoughts?

UPDATE:  We located the owner.  Those of you'uns in small town or rural area will understand this.  The family is a great neighbor of ours, they typically don't let their dogs run loose and keep them fenced in.  Their family and ours are fairly influential in our little community here and we could go full Hatfields and McCoys if we wanted to, but we're not.  The dog's family took it well and accepted responsibility and drove to our spread to apologize in-person and we told each other that we still value each other as great neighbors.  

We'll bury the hatchet at that.  It was just an all around bad situation where the dog's pen unfortunately happened to have several failures at once that let the dog get out.

farming,Hen eggs,Heating up chicken feed before feeding time?,"Hi all, relatively new to chickens but not new to good ideas!

I‚Äôve got a flock of around 10 hens for the last 6 months and recently they haven‚Äôt been eating their feed at all. That was until I‚Äôve been heating up the feed and they have scoffed it all up! 

So I‚Äôm wondering does anyone warm up their chicken feed? I‚Äôve got an egg incubator (obviously) and 30 minutes before feeding time I pop the feed in to heat up. 

Since using warm feed the chickens are eating more and it‚Äôs causing less mess in the garden, maybe the chickens like humans prefer their food warm? anyway as I said they are eating more and appear happier.

Not sure if egg incubating is the only way to heat the feed up, but I‚Äôm sure a microwave, oven or airfryer could work. 

Obviously you can only bake them for so long before the pellets burn, so my last session I settled on 20 minutes in the oven or 5 minutes in the airfryer, not tried the microwave yet. The feed came out hot and smoking and not burnt. 

Anyone else tried this before ? Interested to hear peoples thoughts and if you reckon the chickens will now be unhappy if my husband gives them the cold feed (he thinks it‚Äôs silly to warm the feed up‚Ä¶) 

FYI I‚Äôm using a local sourced Pellet and corn mix feed from a local farm shop UK based.",4,1719530139.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/1dq52hk/heating_up_chicken_feed_before_feeding_time/

They eat ca. 240 kg (~530 lb) of meat in a year, 90% pork (sometimes poultry es. for Christmas or if a hen is not producing eggs anymore).

What is the leanest breed of pig? They need a pig that produces the least amount of lard, organs etc. and the max amount of meat (more meat than bacon).

And how many pigs they need to slaughter in a year? Is 2 enough?

farming,Hen eggs,Roosterless Henhouse Yields Fertilized Egg? - Crosspost from Askreddit,"I have 6 barred rocks laying hens, 1.5 years old, in my henhouse. The henhouse consists of an open top dogrun with fencing 6' high, and a doggy door that leads into an enclosed shed for their indoor coop. These girls have been laying for about a year at a rate of 1-2 eggs apiece per day. I eat the eggs all the time and I also sell them to a handful of friends. I've never once seen a bad or questionable egg. About 6 months ago my ex-husband cracked one open and said there was something strange inside but I chalked it up to it perhaps being rotten. Last week my friend Chad cracked one open and told me this story: There was a baby chicken inside. It was no more than 3/4 of an inch long, but had distinct chicken features, no feathers. The egg white was blood red. The egg smelled bad. He didn't take a picture and says instead he cooked it up and served it to his dog. I have no reason to believe Chad is lying to me aside from the fact that this appears to be an impossibility. I researched cross-species breeding - in case a crow got in there and shtuped one of my girls, but if things like that happened there would be crow-kins everywhere. I researched the Cowbird, who is known to lay in other birds' nests, but their eggs are tiny, like robins eggs, and I can't see how that would have gotten by both myself and Chad without being noticed. I'm stuck. Has anyone ever heard of this happening?

TL;DR: Rooster-less henhouse somehow produces fertilized chicken egg. HOW??

While I don't necessarily have a problem with meat consumption, I've been pretty turned off by factory farming practices . As a result of that, I've started to look into purchasing meat from farms that raise their animals in humane and healthy conditions. Luckily, I live in Virginia and there are quite a few farmer markets/farm delivery services that I can use; there's even one farm that will offer self guided and guided tours of their property. I loved the idea of taking a look at the farm where my meat comes from, but quickly realized that if I were to take a tour I would have no idea what I was actually looking at or looking for.

Basically, what can I do, either in a tour or when browsing a website, to make sure I'm not just falling for advertising aimed at millennials. Are there signs I should look for? Certifications I should confirm? Any advice at all?

This is just a way to try and see if I can raise livestock or not. I asked my family that if I raised rabbits for meat, would they be interested in trying some.

So my question for you all is... How can I impress most at my upcoming Jersey dairy placement?

I've an awkward placement coming up with a fella who seemed quite apprehensive to accept my request of two weeks with the cows so I'm hoping to get some advice on winning him over and generally being a useful hand on the farm for him and the other hands.

agriculture,Barley,The Decline in Beer Popularity Impacts U.S. Barley Farmers.,"The Decline in Beer Popularity Impacts U.S. Barley Farmers.



The Brewers Association data shows that beer consumption in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in five decades.

The growing popularity of cannabis-infused beverages, fruit-flavored hard seltzers, and ready-to-drink cocktails took away beer‚Äôs market share. These drinks use fermented sugar, vodka, and tequila as alcohol sources and do not use barley.

The once-popular craft beer, which uses four to five times more malt than mass-produced beer, has declined. Last year, for the first time, the number of microbreweries closed outpaced the number of openings.

The situation negatively impacted American barley farmers because most of their produce goes into the malting industry.

In addition, malt barley prices plunged from $7 per bushel to under $5 this year. Moreover, barley supplies in storage rose approximately 51%, the highest level in 14 years.

Thus, beer companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, reduced their barley contracts with farmers due to a supply glut.

Brewers Association chief economist Bart Watson said beer faces stiff competition from products that did not exist 50 years ago.

The Sober Curious movement led to healthier choices and creative drink options but has negatively impacted malt producers.

agriculture,Barley,"Weekly ARG Update for March 12, 2024: Fundamentals, Economics, & What to Watch.","**Weekly ARG Update for March 12, 2024: Fundamentals, Economics, & What to Watch.**

**Fundamentals:**

\-The latest rains sustain the recovery of the soybean and corn production. Both Grain Exchanges in Argentina (Rosario and Buenos Aires) maintain their forecast without changes: soybean between 49.5 and 52.5 MMT and corn between 56.5 and 57 MMT.

\-Digital platform SIOGranos shows increasing sales of soybean in the last two weeks by the farmers. The lineup of soybean meal cargos indicates that March could end with more than 1.6 MMT exported, compatible with 2 MMT of soybean crushed. But this is a floor.

\-Personal sources indicate that the soybean crushing in March could total 2.45 MMT.

**Ag-Economic Environment**

\-The Argentine Peso rebounded against the dollar, and the export dollar blend (80% official / 20% financial) is dropping from AR$920 on February 2nd, to AR$879 on March 8th.

\-The domestic price of the soybean fell from AR$280K in December to AR$250K in March. In the same period, the inflation rate accumulated 50 percentage points.

\-Farmers talk about bankruptcy in their operations due to the lack of profitability, but there is no new Peso devaluation on the horizon. The Government has said that they would prefer the lift of the dollar market restriction, but this has no certain date.

**What to Watch:**

1. Continue monitoring the evolution of the internal prices of the grains, mostly corn and soybean.

2. Also, the exchange rate, especially about the weakness of the dollar against the Peso. The grain value chain could lose competitiveness in a strong Peso scenario.

Both of the above prior could influence the farmers‚Äô planting decisions over the Winter crops (wheat and barley).

3. In the political arena, if the Government achieves an agreement with the Provinces‚Äô governors to approve the mega bill they sent at the start of the mandate, it would be a key success to gain governability.

All units are metric tonne. UA refers to Ukraine, RF to the Russian Federation.

**Prices & Trade Flows:**

* RF wheat dropped below the 200 $/t level and now trade slightly low. Recent tenders took place in Algeria (900k to be shipped in June, at 228 $/t CIF) and Jordan (60k for July, at 236 $/t), both calculated to 190-195 $/t at FOB Black Sea (Russia). Egypt GASC canceled the last tender (March 7) due to unexpectedly high offers (225 $/t CIF Egypt as minimum quoted by Bulgaria).
* Additional grain quota volumes have been allocated in RF, 2.5 MMT as planned. It may allow to export of even more than the 50-51 MMT forecasted as of today (equal to 16-18 MMT left until June 30).
* RF barley follows the wheat trend setting in the range of 170-175 $/t FOB. Another tender in Jordan just confirmed this level (60k for May shipment). EU barley is under pressure due to competitively cheap imported wheat and corn in the domestic markets that could limit any price rebound.

**Fundamental Updates:**

* Some support may come from lower production forecasts of wheat and barley in North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia tend to lose more) due to dry conditions and India‚Äôs key production areas negatively affected last week.
* EU winter wheat and barley were assessed as not too positive (about 70% are in good/excellent condition compared to 90%+ in 2023).
* Huge underestimation of the RF barley and corn export in 23/24 by USDA: The March report again shows 5.8 and 5.3 MMT, respectively, compared to 7.5 and 6.6 MMT expected by local experts.

**What to Watch:**

* Corn price trend amid UA's higher export pace. The corn market is about to decline even further unless a new cut of Brazilian crop estimates or demand will provide an essential support.
* Chinese demand activity: a few cancellations of US wheat (both HRW and SRW) put additional pressure on the market. It is much. cheaper to source in the Black Sea.
* Sowing campaign of spring crops in RF, UA and EU - potential area expansion and conditions (firstly, soil moisture).
* Turkey and Egypt demand for wheat and corn amid steep devaluations. Commodity imports can struggle in these environments.

I was intrigued by this difference and the effect it can have on the landscape and, therefore, in human psychology. Unfortunately, I did not save the website as a bookmark nor is it in my browsing history.

Could anyone please tell me if there is indeed a marked difference between these three kind of grain fields?

agriculture,Barley,"South American Grain Production Update as of November 28, 2023.","**South American Grain Production Update as of November 28, 2023.**  
Here are updated corn and wheat numbers for South America. Please take with the caveat that it is still very early for Brazil and Argentina for different reasons. Brazil‚Äôs second-season corn is at significant risk of widespread areas going unplanted. Argentina‚Äôs elections pushed back decision-making and payments for the input industry.  
**Corn**  
Easy Newz projects South American production at 177.37, a decline of 22 million or 11% from our initial estimates. USDA projects 14 million tonnes higher at 191, on par with 2022/23.Brazil 113.41 (USDA 129), Argentina 56.1 (USDA 55), Paraguay 5.55 (USDA 5.1), Bolivia 1.05 (USDA 1.125) and Uruguay 1.26 (USDA 1)  
**Wheat**  
Easy Newz estimates South American wheat production at 26.41, a decline of 3.32 million or 11.2% from our initial estimates. USDA is at 26.85, not including FAS revisions, or 1.5% above Easy Newz.Brazil 9.69 (USDA 9.4), Argentina 15.07 (USDA 15), Paraguay .976 (USDA 1.1), Bolivia .306 (USDA .3) and Uruguay .967 (USDA 1.05)\*FAS sent updates for grains in Brazil (11/6) and Argentina (10/30). There were reductions in corn and wheat production. The latest WASDE did not reflect these.  
**Other grain comments**  
Sorghum prices in Argentina offer better potential risk-adjusted returns in peripheral areas. There is upside potential, similar to our barley figures.Cotton is going to gain acres in center-west and northern Brazil. It is a better crop for the heat. How many soybean acres and Safrina corn acres will be lost is unclear.Rice is gaining acres across Brazil and in northern Argentina. Areas like Corrientes are replenishing reservoirs and retaining ponds after drying out during the previous two El Ni√±o campaigns. Water levels were reduced 95% to 100%.  
**Easy Newz Comments**  
Brazil‚Äôs corn crop is the wild card. There are three trends currently hurting the production outlook.

1. 2023/24 is the first year since 2016/17 that total planted acreage will decline nationally.
2. Profit margins are near break-even in many states. Farmers will be much less likely to push planting windows at current price levels.
3. Safra corn in the south and dry weather in the north will leave widespread areas unseeded. Safrina is a significant wildcard. Hot weather (ideally with close to normal rains) and rapid development are needed to ensure farmers have the best opportunity to plant in the second season.

Wheat expectations should stabilize as recent reports in Argentina indicate the sub 13 mmt production now appears unlikely. This is good news for farmers still suffering from last year‚Äôs drought, but 2024 prices are unattractive today.If the USA is going to have a chance to be competitive in shipping corn to China and other Asian destinations, these weather trends need to stay in place. Brazil‚Äôs domestic ethanol and feed industries are booming. Production losses will limit exports.  
**Easy Newz disclaimer**  
It is early, and we recognize this. An early anchor to start each crop campaign can be an edge for managing risks, thinking about rotations, and positioning assets. We hope you find it helpful.An excellent way to understand crop development and trends is to compare to USDA figures. Since Easy Newz will provide forward forecasts and update regularly, the trend versus the USDA will give an idea of how the weather impacts other regions and countries.Questions or thoughts are welcome.

Here Easy Newz crop estimates with ABARES September and December figures in parentheses. All units are million metric tonnes (mmt).

Wheat       25.35 (25.4 Sep v 25.5 Dec)

Barley       11.17  (10.5 Sep v 10.8 Dec)

Canola      5.43  (5.2 Sep v 5.5 Dec)

Sorghum   1.76  (1.5 Sep, unchanged Dec)

Cotton       1.06  (1.2 Sep v .925 Dec)

Easy Newz Comments

ABARES reported total winter production at 46.1 versus 45.2 mmt previously. This followed Easy Newz direction with Wheat, Barley, and Canola higher. Last year‚Äôs growing conditions were near perfect and set national records by a significant margin. Cotton was lowered to 925k, more than Easy Newz expected, and sorghum was unchanged.

A wetter pattern arrived in early November. The last 30 days' anomalies show 100% to 300% of normal in the south and east. Localized areas have received much more. The focus has shifted from talk of very low potential wheat yields to declining wheat quality in New South Wales and Victoria.

Central Western Australia and Queensland have received needed precipitation, but vast areas of these states missed out. Total winter production is expected to be in line with the 10-year average. The summer planting outlook should improve marginally with the recent precipitation improvement.

Not featured in this report will be livestock, but hopefully the wetter shift will slow the recent liquidations as farmers pushed animals to market in anticipation of higher feed costs and lower profitability.

Agriculture reporting in the United States dates back over 100 years, and the modern version of the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) dates back 50 years this month.

The first Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimates was released on September 17, 1973, and focused on the domestic market. In October 1980, the government began producing world supply and demand estimates. The government focused on domestic, major importers, major exporters, and global figures. Individual countries were separated in early 1985.

Canada is dealing with more than 500 active wildfires due to drought in the western prairies and eastern parts of the country. Haze and air quality alerts affect almost one-third of Americans from the northern plains to the east coast and into the Carolinas.

Canada is experiencing one of the most widespread droughts in decades. Luckily, the temperatures have remained mild, not yet having the potential impact on crops like 2021. Good to excellent ratings for spring wheat have fallen from 87% to 70% and canola from 81% to 66% over the last four weeks.

Canada grows most of its row crops from central Manitoba, heading west to the foot of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta. Saskatchewan and Alberta are the worst-hit provinces, with soil moisture below 50% over the growing areas. The heart of the wheat and canola-producing regions is less than one-third of normal.

Farmers are still waiting to sound the alarm, but current forecasts have very little rain. The Canadian model is showing the potential for hotter temperatures into mid-July. The GFS remains much milder. Smaller grain and food markets such as barley, oats, lentils, and pulses will need to take notice.

Haze and smoke over the continental USA are expected to diminish into the holiday weekend, but these problems are not going away.

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

agriculture,Barley,Global Seed Treatment Fungicides Biological Market Segmentation and Analysis 2025,"  

**Seed Treatment Fungicides Market: Introduction**

Seed treatment can be defined as treating seeds with additionally required chemicals such as Imidaclorpid 48% FS, Metalaxyl 35 WS, and others, that are used to biologically improve the seeds quality and protect the seeds. This process is used in order to control diseases and infections caused owing to soil borne infections, false smut, fungal disease, blight and root rot, termite bunt, and loose smut, among others. Fungicide seed treatments aids in protecting seedlings from getting effected due to both seed pathogens and soil. Seed-borne pathogens are those accommodated on the seed surface, or those located in the inner part of the seed. Soil-borne pathogens contaminates the seed or seedling, which is the main cause of the growth of both non-parasitic and parasitic diseases.

**Market Dynamics**

Some of the major factors driving the seed treatment fungicides market include the increasing demand for genetically modified seeds, coupled with rising use of fungicides for crop protection is fueling the market growth. As the fungicides ensure high farm yields, and also improve the protection from harmful organisms, the demand for seed treatment fungicides is expected to grow. Moreover, increasing demand for feedstock such as farming seeds will further enhance the product demand over the projected period.

The market is expected to restrain due to the increasing use of treated seeds among farmers. According to Agricultural Health Study (AHS), more than 90% of farmers in North Carolina and Iowa use seed treated seeds only, while very few farmers are using fungicides for seed treatment. Moreover, according to FAO stats, Iowa led the U.S. corn production in 2015, which was followed by Nebraska and Illinois. Both these states produced over 2 billion corn crop bushels in 2015, while states such as Indiana and Minnesota produced only 1 billion corn bushels in 2015.

**Market Segmentation**

The seed treatment fungicides market has been categorized into crop type, product type, process, form and geography. On the basis of crop type the market is segmented into integrated cereals & grains, oil seeds, fruits & vegetables, flowers & ornaments Seed. Based on product type the market is categorized into captan, difenoconazole, biological agents, carboxin, and PNCB among others. Seed treatment fungicides market based on process is divided into seed coatings fungicides, seed dressing fungicides and seed pelleting fungicides among others. Form segment is segmented into powder and liquid. Seed dressing fungicides is the most regularly used technique, this is majorly due to easy procedure and low cost when compared to others. Economical earthen pots are used for mixing chemicals with seeds otherwise seed can be spread on a polythene sheet and essential quantity of chemical can be sprinkled over the seeds and mixed automatically by the farmers with the help of machinery. Seed dressing fungicides technique is basically a biological process, which is being used in various crop types such as in pigeon pea, sugarcane, chilies and tomatoes among others.

**Regional Analysis**

North America accounted for the largest market share in 2017. Strict government regulations towards curbing and reducing the use of agrochemicals such as pesticides along with growing consumer awareness regarding the presence of fertilizer remains in the produce, has resulted in a substantial growth in demand for seed treatment fungicides. As per the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA); seedling-blight diseases and smuts caused in barley, wheat, oats, and others can be controlled by seed treatment fungicides, that helps to kill the infections causing diseases inside the seed during germination. Asia Pacific market is anticipated to be experience a swift growth in the seed treatment fungicides market over the forecast period. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2017, India and China are the key producers of wheat globally. As per a article published by FAO in 2017 India produced 93.34 million tons of wheat in 2017.

agriculture,Wheat,2023 National Wheat Yield Winners succeeded during a year of adversity.,"2023 National Wheat Yield Winners succeeded during a year of adversity.

The 2022 and 2023 growing seasons were dominated by challenging conditions as the transition from La Ni√±a to El Ni√±o was supposed to bring relief to the western USA, but a blocking pattern led to one of the driest May and June periods on record. Over half of all winter and spring wheat areas were affected by drought.

What makes the National Wheat Yield Contest stand out is the emphasis on quality and quantity. Most yield competitions celebrate records, but in this competition, the winners‚Äô samples now head to the mills. There will be additional prizes for those meeting the standard of outstanding quality.

This year‚Äôs 12 national winners represent 12 states and averaged 144 bushels per acre. Not far behind were 83 other individual state winners representing 28 states. This group averaged an incredible 127 bushels per acre. There are a variety of categories, with some winners determined by absolute yields and others above their local county averages.

agriculture,Wheat,Nebraska-Lincoln and Morocco partner up to fight wheat diseases.,"At first glance, central Nebraska and Morocco have very little in common. Two distinct cultures separated by almost 5,000 miles. Yet common diseases farmers in both locations brought this project between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Morocco together.

Fungal diseases are common problems for wheat producers around the world. China's harvest rains caused millions of tonnes of production losses to its winter wheat crop. Nebraska farmers dealt with a head blight epidemic as recently as 2015. Morocco is forced to import grains for each lost to diseases. These supply shocks can lead to food price spikes or even famine.

The most common wheat diseases are root rot, crown rot, and head blight. A Professor leading the project, Wegulo, has studied Fusarium head blight and emphasizes the seriousness of the fungus:

agriculture,Wheat,My wheat crop was destroyed by an unknown force/animal/insect,"I am inexperienced and this is my first attempt at growing wheat. I planted 400 square feet of Spring wheat in May and it has disappeared.

 As title states, I planted a 40 foot by 10 foot rectangle of wheat in a field at my friends cabin. It has a large area of fields and woodland around it. 

I visited my wheat a few times throughout the summer and it was looking great. Even two weeks ago it was still good, just turning yellow and drying out. I came to harvest it today and the wheat berries at the top of the grass stalk have disappeared. It's like they had been cut off. 

This is a secluded property in the wilderness and nobody has been here besides my friend and I. Could it have been destroyed by locusts, birds, or aliens?

agriculture,Wheat,Wheat protein and gluten percentages - high intra-species and seasonal variation?,"Hi folks, I've recently been reading up on wheat varieties and composition and was hoping that folks here could help me out with some questions I have.

I'll try and keep it brief. I live in Australia, and I'm having an incredibly difficult time finding whole durum wheat to purchase as a consumer. This seems insane to me, but that's beside the point (if anyone has leads here, I'd greatly appreciate them). It seems that what is available to purchase are things like triticale and khorasan, which perhaps have similar qualities to durum from a culinary perspective.

From a culinary perspective, I'm interested in gluten content and protein content. People prize durum for being a hard wheat (in the high protein sense), with relatively low gluten. Triticale and khorasan seem to have similar properties. However when I went to look at these properties in the literature, what I found was that the protein and gluten content varied wildly in all of these species on a variety-to-variety level (paper is this one: [https://doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.13151](https://doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.13151)).

For people that can't view the full text, there is a table of different wheats with their protein percentage, gluten percentage by weight, and the ratio of these two. In summary: everything is all over the place. The durums have both quite low protein:gluten ratios, as well as very high ones. The hard spring wheat has the lowest protein:gluten ratio. The 'softest' durum has almost the lowest absolute protein percentage and gluten percentage, while the 'hardest' durum has the highest absolute protein percentage and gluten percentage. Khorasan and emmer are somewhere in the middle. Winter spelt has consistently fairly low gluten and protein, and spring spelt has consistently high gluten and protein.

I can only assume that the same is true of different growing regions and seasons.

So my questions:

* Am I right in saying that variation in gluten content and protein among different cultivars of the same species can be larger than the variation between different species?
* Am I right in saying that the variation in gluten content and protein among different growing regions can be larger than the variation between species?
* Is all of this 'use durum for pasta and hard winter wheat for bread' merely a rule of thumb? In reality, the particular crop of wheat and cultivar you get may be terrible for the application it's usually used for, because that year/region/cultivar was hugely different.
* More of an industry question, but: do suppliers go and do the testing of all of these values (either with an external lab, or themselves) like protein and gluent content? Will they tell me if I ask nicely?

I'm asking this because I recall someone mentioning something towards me about a type of animal or breed that gives milk without having recently been pregnant. That was quite some time ago, so I might remember incorrectly.

agriculture,Milk,"Bird Flu Found in US Dairy Herds: It‚Äôs Emergence, What‚Äôs Being Done About It & How To Spot It","**Bird Flu Found in US Dairy Herds: It‚Äôs Emergence, What‚Äôs Being Done About It & How To Spot It**

Since avian influenza, or bird flu, first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997, it has hit the headlines at various times over the last three decades with varying degrees of alarm.

The latest outbreak in the US is also generating worrying headlines, but with good reason. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 has been detected amongst dairy cows and has spread to two humans.

The strain affecting the US dairy herds was originally an outbreak that drastically affected wild birds and poultry in Europe in 2020, before spreading to North America and having a similar devastating effect on the bird species found there. It is dead, infected birds being found on farms that are the cause of the recent outbreak. The statistics of infected wild birds and poultry are big ‚Äì ver 82 million cases of poultry being infected have been reported as of March 2024, including commercial birds and those kept as pets.

The new outbreak, spread between cows via contaminated surfaces, is being investigated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and has been found in cattle in Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, and New Mexico so far. The cows' symptoms have included decreased lactation and reduced appetite, among others.

**It‚Äôs not all bad news**

Even though it has spread to two humans since 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have deemed the risk to the general public to be low as testing has detected no genetic changes in the strain that makes transition to humans easier. The latest person infected was found to work closely with cattle, making infection more likely, and they have been successfully treated with antiviral flu medicines and advised to isolate.

There is also little risk to the public when it comes to consumption of commercial dairy products, as milk from affected cows is being destroyed and the act of legally required pasteurization kills any pathogens in the produce.

For dairy farmers the news is good too as there is reported to be little loss in earnings from affected cows. This is because milk levels appear to be unaffected by the symptomatic low milk supplies, and there are low infection numbers amongst cattle populations, and a zero mortality rate.

**However, caution should be taken**

Due to the constantly evolving nature of the pathogen and the fact that this is a changing situation, a cautious approach should be taken by farmers, backyard bird keepers, and the public alike.

The USDA, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and other government departments are constantly monitoring the biosecurity situation and are carrying out rigorous testing of biological samples from birds and cattle. When it comes to the bird part of the problem, some areas of wildlife refuges may have limited public access, to prevent infection in humans or their pets.

Guidelines have also been published to help prevent further spread of the virus, which includes the reporting of bird deaths for testing, not allowing captive birds ‚Äì pets or commercial ‚Äì to mix with wild birds, and to avoid the handling of dead birds with bare hands. Additionally, game hunters are advised to not eat sick game, prepare any game outdoors, and pay strict attention to hygiene when preparing or cooking game.

**How to spot avian flu symptoms in cattle**

* Decreased milk production
* Thicker consistency of milk
* Loose stools
* Dehydration
* Lethargy
* Fever

If a herd is affected then the best course of action for the owner is to isolate the animals displaying symptoms before calling their usual veterinarian and State Veterinarian in order to submit samples for testing.  Currently, cattle can be expected to make a full recovery.

**How to spot avian flu symptoms in birds**

* Reduced appetite
* Lethargy
* Decreased production and quality of eggs
* Swelling and discoloration of eyes, wattles, combs, and legs
* Coughing and sneezing
* Loose stools
* Sudden death

Flock owners should follow strict biosecurity measures daily and report any sick or dead birds to their usual veterinarian or State Veterinarian for advice and testing.

**Symptoms in humans**

* Fever
* Cough
* Sore throat
* Runny nose
* Muscle aches
* Headaches
* Shortness of breath
* Loose stools
* Irritated eyes

While H5N1 is rare in humans, it is possible to catch it from close interaction with dairy herds or birds, and the appropriate PPE and strict hygiene measures are advised for those working with such animals.

Symptoms can be mild for some but extremely severe for others and can even lead to respiratory failure and sepsis. If a person suffering the above symptoms has cause to think they may have contracted avian flu it is important to seek the appropriate medical help.

**Moving forward**

Although this latest outbreak is concerning, the public can be well assured that the risk to their health is vanishingly small and that they can continue to enjoy the dairy products, eggs, and poultry that the farmers across America strive to produce.

The USDA and other departments are working with farmers and the public to ensure biosecurity measures are adhered to in order to preserve the health and safety of the people and animals involved.

Commercial farmers and backyard keepers of chickens can play their part by remaining vigilant and sticking to the government guidelines when it comes to the rearing of their animals. The general public can also help prevent contracting the virus by taking sensible measures if they come across dead wildlife.

Some quick background; I'm currently serving in the Royal Navy as a promoted leader and have been here for 8 years. I grew up on a farm as a child and early teens driving Massey's for my great uncle and later on a little experience on a dairy on England, but my experience with milking is very limited.

I have finally handed in my notice with a years left, and I would like to follow my passion into a career in agriculture , there's nothing more I'd rather do.

In terms of how I achieve this, my initial plan was to enter an agri collage and study for a degree , on the other hand I find maybe getting smaller courses (such as tractor handling course etc) and getting and immediate job to gain experience would also be a good start.

Any thoughts or advice for someone that wants to start a career in agri? All advice welcome.

As someone who grew up in a suburban neighborhood many are confused when I tell them I am an agriculture business major. They wonder how someone who grew up in a neighborhood could know anything about agriculture. As I wonder why people would look down at me for my choice in study, I remember that most Americans are two generations removed from the farm and do not have the same passions and opportunities I do. I grew up in the city but with family farms to visit and work at whenever I wanted or could. I have run fence, sorted cows, bailed hay, and fed calves that for various reasons couldn‚Äôt get their milk from their mothers. Looking back on my experiences and memories I feel blessed to have this experience and that is what drives my passion towards agriculture.

When I decided to go to school for agriculture business I looked forward to learn more about the agriculture industry little did I know that in doing so I would be able to teach family and friends about the things I am learning to help try and bridge the knowledge gap in doing so. Family members that were raised around farming as kids but moved to the city understand one form of farming, either beef or dairy, and take the word of the media for all other agriculture. When I was about to leave for school, I had my aunt question me on why I would want to get into an industry that allowed gmo‚Äôs to cause cancer. I honestly didn‚Äôt have an answer. I knew what genetically modified organisms were and I knew they were a benefit to agriculture, but I didn‚Äôt understand how to back up my arguments or even how to have the discussion. In going through school, I have learned that. I have brough research into conversations about agriculture. If someone asks me a question on something I am unfamiliar with I can look it up to give them a knowledgeable answer. I am no longer anxious but excited to get the opportunity to have these discussions.

The agriculture industry gets into trouble in my opinion because we think everyone is given the same information when that is not true. What happens instead is activist groups and competitors give information to the public and that is taken as what all agriculture is. Myths about poultry, egg, milk, beef, and pork production all have myths that are believed by the general public. People are told that animals are abused, that farm conditions are dangerous and overcrowded. What the public doesn‚Äôt hear is all the times that farmers stay up with a calf in the hopes that it sees the morning. They don‚Äôt see the studies that tell farmers the optimal space to hold their animals in order to keep stress low for the animals. They see what people tell them and without farm experience or access to information the farmers bring they will never understand how much farmers care about their livestock. I have tried to explain this to friends from home and many times I hear a response along the lines of, ‚Äúthey only care because it cost them money.‚Äù The truth is even if it is a monetary loss, most farmers will do their best to see their animals be healthy and comfortable because it helps the animals first. If more farmers can express the thoughts and processes that go into their day to day farming, it may help the public change the public‚Äôs opinions on what farming is and why people in agriculture are so passionate.",42,1601776596.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/j4r3jf/experiences_i_have_as_an_agriculture_student/

Since becoming a farmer without any experience isn't easy, this guide will help you come clean and understand the basic steps you need to take to do so.

&#x200B;

First of all, it is important to understand what farmers do in the first place.

## [What does a farmer do?](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/How-to-start-a-farming-business-Step-By-Step-Guide.html)

Farmers are all people who work in the primary sector and keep living organisms either for the production of food or raw materials (e.g. cotton) and thus generate an income. Farmers are closely connected to nature and spend most of their time out in the fields, either cultivating crops or raising animals. 

Today, however, this is only partially true. Modern greenhouse operators, for example, often spend the whole day indoors in their plants. Farmers usually do not have fixed working hours. Because they are dealing with living organisms, their schedule often gets thrown upside down. It's not that easy to have a structured work schedule. Some of them don't even have holidays or days off. To be successful in farming

## Step 1: Decide what to grow and in which field - Can I make a profit?

### Choosing the right crop

&#x200B;

First of all, you need to decide what you want to grow. Even if this sounds easy at first, it is the most complicated decision. The type of crop (or livestock) you choose is perhaps the most important decision you will make. Depending on the type of production, we divide agriculture into the following categories:

### Farming

Arboriculture (commercial cultivation of fruit trees), vegetable and fruit cultivation, timber production, biomass production, grain cultivation, green forage cultivation, herb cultivation, viticulture (grape cultivation), berry cultivation, special crops such as cotton, etc. Most of these crops are grown outdoors. 

However, some can also be grown indoors (greenhouses) using soil or air/water as a substrate.

### Animal husbandry

Farmers keep animals here mainly for their milk, meat, or eggs. Some examples of this are cows, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry (chickens, ducks, etc.). Some authorities do not consider poultry farming as livestock but as a separate category.",15,1647112573.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/tcoln7/how_to_start_a_farming_business_step_by_step_guide/
agriculture,Milk,The Art and Science of Agriculture,"&#x200B;

[ The Art and Science of Agriculture ](https://preview.redd.it/lsm93ufz7kn81.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=209b63ee684f9fdd2b52467b9a97b6c52dd3721e)

 

Agriculture is the art and science of plowing, cultivating the land, and taking care of animals. This includes the preparation of plant and animal products for human consumption and their distribution in markets.

Agriculture provides most of the world‚Äôs food and textiles. Cotton, wool, and leather are agricultural products. Agriculture also provides timber for construction and paper products.

These products and the cultivation methods used may vary between continents.

## [Start of Farming](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/The-Art-and-Science-of-Agriculture.html)

Over the centuries, the development of agriculture has contributed to the emergence of civilizations.

Before agriculture spread, people spent most of their lives finding food, hunting wild animals, and collecting wild plants. About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned to grow cereals and root crops and adapted them to rural life.

2000 years ago, most of the world‚Äôs population depended on agriculture. Scientists do not know why these changes are happening in agriculture, but they may be a result of climate change.

When the people began to farm, they also began to raise wild animals. Domestication is the adaptation of wild plants and animals to humans.

Perhaps the first crop to be cultivated was rice or corn. It was built by Chinese farmers in 7500 BCE

The first pets were dogs used in hunting. Sheep and goats are likely to be cared for later. People also take care of cattle and pigs. Many of these animals were once hunted for meat and meat. There are now many sources of milk, cheese, and butter. After all, people use pets like bulls for plowing, transportation, and transportation.

Agriculture allowed people to produce excess food. If the harvest fails, they can use this surplus food or replace it with other goods. Overeating allows people to do other non-agricultural work.

Agriculture kept nomads close to their farms and led to the development of permanent villages. It's about trade. New economies have been successful in some areas as cities have grown and cultures have grown. The first civilizations based on intensive agriculture appeared in Mesopotamia (now Iraq and Iran) near the rivers Tigris and Euphrates and along the Nile in Egypt.

### Advanced Technologies

For millennia, the development of rural areas has been very slow. The fire was one of the first agricultural implements. Native Americans used fire to control the growth of fruit plants that they knew would grow quickly after a massive fire. Farmers plowed small fields by hand, cut down trees with axes, and dug firewood to break up and cover the soil. Over time, advanced agricultural equipment made of bone, stone, copper, and iron was developed. New methods of storage have been developed. People began collecting food in pots and pits lined with clay to use during the famine. They have also started making pots and other containers for transportation and cooking.

About 5500 BC In the third century BC. BC. Farmers in Mesopotamia developed simple irrigation systems. By diverting water from streams to their farms, farmers are living in areas that were previously unsuitable for agriculture. In Mesopotamia and later in Egypt and China, people organized and worked together to build and maintain better irrigation systems.

Early farmers also developed advanced types of crops. For example, about 6000 B.C. New grain in South Asia and Egypt. It is stronger than previous flakes. The crusts are easier to remove and can be baked into bread.

As the Romans expanded their empires, they adopted the best agricultural practices from the people they conquered. They wrote manuals on agricultural activities in Africa and Asia and adapted them for Europe.

The Chinese also adapted agricultural equipment and methods from neighboring empires. The rice variety from Vietnam matures quickly, allowing farmers to harvest multiple crops in one planting season. This rice quickly became popular throughout China.",7,1647355548.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/teqmjf/the_art_and_science_of_agriculture/

Some farmers have equipped the animals with a necklace that tracks movements and the number of times they went to the milking robot. However, that technology is purely descriptive, as it tells you what has happened, as it answers questions around: when did the individual cow go milking, how much did they walk around in a given time period.

We will also have a couple jersey cows for milk.

&#x200B;

We will sell eggs, milk, butter, ice cream, and cheese. As well as the crops and live birds/chicks locally.

The cows will most likely come a year or two after the birds though seeing as we are new to agriculture except for a farm my dad worked on back in the 70s.

&#x200B;

I will have one LGD, maybe two depending on if I feel like there are enough predators to justify that. The breed is still to be decided, but either a Great Pyrenees or Maremma. As well as that, a couple barn cats.

agriculture,Milk,New to all of this and have questions,"First of all hello everyone. I want to say that I am sorry if i am posting this in the wrong place. I will be posting the same thing in a few other subs since i am not sure who will answer my questions. Also sorry about my english i am not a native speaker.

Here's the thing: I live in Turkey Ankara. It has harsh winters but other than that the weather is really good. I want to start a small farm out of the city and the reason for this is because i want to live outside the city as much as possible, I am really interested in farming and livestock, I think it's the best possible occupation since you really work with your body and your own hands and work with nature to grow your own food and other needs which is really interesting for me. I love working with my hands and want to learn so many things along with farming like woodworking too.

The problem is i have no idea about farming. I lived in the city my whole life. At first i was really afraid to take the first step but now i feel ready and really excited. I know that i might screw up but thats ok, i really want to do this and because of that i decided to buy a land and start as soon as possible so that i could learn from my screw ups as soon as possible, and get this thing going. 

About the land I am planning on buying. I am not sure how big it is in english in Turkish it is going to be between 2-3 dunams (donum). I guess its about 3 quarters of an acre, i am not sure. (2000-3000 square meters)

Another thing about me is: I am a vegetarian and am really interested in growing fruits and vegetables, I would love to have many fruit trees in my land. Also I don't want to be an industrial farmer, i would love to have 4 or 5 enterprises in my farm such as beekeeping, some chickens for eggs, milk and milk products would be great but i am afraid it might be a little too hard, maybe growing mushrooms etc.

As you can see i am interested in a lot of things and i am sure i would get interested in some other enterprises as i learn about them as well. I have started a beekeeping course and am learning a lot and i will be working with a beekeeper as soon as spring comes so i can learn even more.

My question is, when i buy my land, how should i go about doing all of this. I thought i would plant some fruit trees at first, when it is time plant some vegetables. As soon as it's the end of spring or maybe early summer i might buy some bees. And as time passes buy some chickens after a year. Get into more and more enterprises advancing the previous ones etc. 

Is there anything i should know, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am really scared and sometimes get anxious about all of this. It is too much of a change from the life i had. What should my priorities be? I just need a guideline to know what to do as soon as i get the land. I am afraid that i won't know what to do and end up failing completely.

Thank you all in advance. I hope i can do this.",8,1414873020.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/2l0645/new_to_all_of_this_and_have_questions/

agriculture,Meat,WHAT THE STATE OF THE 2024 UNION MEANS FOR AGRICULTURE," 

‚ÄúInvesting in America‚Äù  
\-President Biden spoke of going from the inside out. Much of the United States in the interior is agriculturally driven, yet much of the following interpretations held little to quell the concerns from producers.

‚ÄúBuy American‚Äù  
\-Yes, yes, yes! Buy American, specifically from the United States! Unfortunately, politicians and lobbyists continue to kill a little thing called COOL, or Country of Origin Labeling, where you know exactly where your meat products originate. You may be eating Brazilian, Chinese, South African, French, or any other nation‚Äôs steak, but you will never know because the meat has no label to specify its origin. We need to push for proper labeling for consumers to know exactly where their food was grown, processed, and sold. To buy American, you must know the product is American.

‚ÄúCreating thousands of jobs‚Ä¶‚Äù  
\-Jobs are created everywhere yet the role of farmer and rancher continues to erode. If we want food security we need to reverse course through better incentives, programs, and solutions that have yet to be suggested by either U.S. political party.

‚ÄúHigh-speed internet for urban and rural America, alike‚Äù  
\-Yes, it would be helpful to promote and illustrate the everyday production of food through meat and crops, but what real change does this provide? Not much, please move on to something more important. A few suggestions may start with the items above‚Ä¶

‚ÄúInvestment in Family Farms‚Äù  
\-Supposedly there are programs that promote keeping farms within families and are ‚Äútransformative‚Äù, yet we have not seen them. This is not a slight to current congress or the president. We understand policy takes time. However, the question is, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù If you refer to the take of ‚ÄúCreating jobs‚Ä¶‚Äù you will understand where there is a disconnect. We see no incentive to continue family farms and ranches. The younger generations continue to walk away because they cannot afford to continue this endeavor. Instead, billionaires like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and others systematically purchase thousands of acres of land and limit production or sell off bits to make more money through subdivisions. We do not condone or ask for government money to continue our heritage and way of life, but we assure you investment in family farms is far from a reality.

‚ÄúCharging more and more, for less and less‚Äù  
\-Refer to COOL and the meat packers. Since the pandemic years meat packers like JBS, Cargill, Tyson, and National Beef have drastically increased meat prices at the grocery store without compensation for the producer. Instead of saying, ‚ÄúWe need our share,‚Äù we instead argue this is unnecessary. The increased price of meat is criminal. Fewer and fewer people can buy beef. We want consumers to have the ability to buy beef for every meal, not just on special occasions. The packers are taking not pennies, but dollars from consumers and producers alike while selling non-American meet without COOL regulations.

‚ÄúCutting carbon emissions in half‚Ä¶‚Äù  
\-The beef industry has been vilified as the next world criminal due to the bodily functions the livestock which has been domesticated for thousands of years. Yet now we are one of the supposed largest issues to environmental and climate change when we do everything in our power to preserve, conserve, and protect the land in which we love and cultivate each year through the growth of livestock and/or crops. What does the goal of cutting carbon emissions do for the agriculture community? Especially, when the consumption of grasses by bovine and the production of meat the feeds multiple families result in a net gain of zero carbon production. We would like to see specifics on carbon emission claims‚Ä¶",43,1709871857.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/1b9f0x4/what_the_state_of_the_2024_union_means_for/

agriculture,Meat,Small Ag Businesses Using Profit First Accounting,"Hi everyone\~

I'm brand spankin' new to the goat grazing/breeding/meat business and setting up my books. I was wondering if any small business owners here are using the Profit First method of accounting and would share how it's working out. Did you switch to or from it (from a cash basis maybe) and can you offer a brief comparison of how each worked for you?

I'm hiring a CPA because I'm terrified of numbers and taxes and compliance issues. Of the few I've talked to, only one is familiar with PF, and she's not confident about it being a fit for me.

She says ag business owners have a lot of flexibility with taxes, like being able to defer expenses, or prepay expenses, or put income into a prior year as an accrual, etc., and with PF you sacrifice those abilities because you have to calculate targets and make automatic transfers.

Is that flexibility she's talking about because of the nature of ag businesses, because we sometimes, say, prepay for goods to secure a price on hay, or because the government treats us special at tax time, or...? Ugh, I don't even know if I'm asking the right questions. Hence the outsourcing, lol...

Environmentally, it sounds like a great idea because the electricity required to run it will come from wind turbines, and the farm will not use any pesticides. 

I am curious about vertical and indoor farming and if it holds the potential to really become the future of how humankind will grow food. There is obviously no doubt about the benefits of such farming over conventional land based agricultural practices in terms of sustainability and CO2 emissions. Please prove me wrong if this is not the case. But from a food culture point of view, how many people around the world are okay with a diet where leafy greens form the staple portion of their meals?

Obviously in the Uk the climate directs most cattle to consume grass for at least half of the year.. I believe I saw a figure quoting about 80% of the time/feed for cows is grass and the 20% is grain, which makes up both the winter period AND the finishing \[i.e. fattening up the cows with grain and beans for meat flavour before slaughtering \]   
(the rest being silage) ..

agriculture,Meat,Austrian researchers develop a model to predict global shocks to the food system.,"Researchers in Austria have built a tool that can simulate how sudden shocks in the agricultural system will affect food availability around the globe. These can range from the War in Ukraine to weather catastrophes.

*‚ÄúHere we present a multilayer network model that takes into account both trade between countries and the production dependencies among products‚Ä¶ Our model allows us to simulate shocks to the production of individual products and to assess the resulting losses of the same and other products in countries around the globe.‚Äù*

The system's building blocks required replicating the current global and interconnected system of 125 foods and production across 192 countries. A key input was distinguishing foods traded directly and those grown for conversion into something else. Most previous studies focused on all foods as direct relationships or trade flows and did not consider foods needing conversion, an indirect form of trade.

Researchers simulated a shock in Ukraine that could lead to a full loss of production in Ukraine, such as a nuclear strike and the subsequent fallout. This sudden shock would lead to losses of up to 89% sunflower oil, 85% corn, and 25% poultry meat. The poultry meat would be an indirect loss, but food depriving nonetheless.",0,1689702769.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/1535bn4/austrian_researchers_develop_a_model_to_predict/

Agriculture reporting in the United States dates back over 100 years, and the modern version of the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) dates back 50 years this month.

The first Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimates was released on September 17, 1973, and focused on the domestic market. In October 1980, the government began producing world supply and demand estimates. The government focused on domestic, major importers, major exporters, and global figures. Individual countries were separated in early 1985.

Farmers and traders often take issues with the figures from one report to the next, but it is easy to forget the years of work that have generated the most extensive collection of fundamental agricultural data worldwide.

The agriculture reports cover soybeans, corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, oats, cotton, and sugar. Livestock includes meat animals, poultry, and dairy.

agriculture,Meat,"The Salad Oil King, the greatest agriculture heist.","Anthony De Angelis was born in New York City during the height of World War I. From an early age, his entrepreneurship and determination were defining features. Throughout his life, his ambition was masked by his physical appearance. At 5 feet 5 inches tall, overweight, and sporting horned glasses, it was easy to overlook him.

His first venture was a candy store he borrowed $500 to open and quickly went under. He went to work in a meat and fish market. De Angelis rose speedily and saved his money. In 1938, he opened a butchery that would make him a wealthy man then.

Anthony then started a packing company and would secure deals with governments and other institutions, filling a large void. His first success and indication of his moral compass was a $1 million deal with the Yugoslavia government to deliver lard. He would settle with them for $100,000 after providing a spoiled product.

He next bought the majority interest of the North Bergen, New Jersey meatpackers outfit and used this to secure a 19 million pound USDA lunch program. He would deliver only 10% of the contract in inedible products and eventually pay $100,000 for his mistake. He was now blacklisted from such programs. But there were more immense opportunities out there.

De Angelis bought the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation and its tank farm in 1955 for $500,000. He understood the demand for soybean oil was outpacing supplies from the midwest, and being in the middle was his next big opportunity.

What Anthony De Angelis needed in a competitive location or access to the Mississippi River, he would make up in volume. He began undercutting the prices of other exporters to get the supply contracts. He then set up companies under the USDA‚Äôs Food for Peace Program.

Less than five years later, he assumed the rightful title of Salad Oil King. There was no doubt he believed his place had been rightfully secured. He wined and dined with foreign dignitaries and industry professionals alike. His employees were loyal only to him and highly compensated for it.

*‚ÄúI have a brilliant and productive mind, and I could do more for our fats and oils business than anyone else in the world. I knew, as president of Allied, that I could go out and sell all the vegetable oil that this country could ever produce.‚Äù*

Even when foreign governments or government agencies caught him red-handed, he quickly cut a check or blamed a scapegoat. The accusations ranged from simple tax evasion to shorting $70 million worth of food to third-world countries. The fines were quickly paid, and Anthony returned to business as usual.

Anthony‚Äôs big heist was just around the corner. Utilizing his auditors and a new entrant in the commodity financing space, American Express, the Bayonne tank farm would have the potential to print money. It was only a matter of time before everyone wanted a piece of his business.

In all, 51 companies would have a position on the other side of the Salad Oil King. None would notice that his supposed inventory exceeded the entire inventory reported by the USDA. De Angelis would be extended, credit-effectively creating his own money against one billion pounds of soybean and cottonseed oil.

Anthony would go to extraordinary lengths to keep the con on track, including tanks filled with seawater with a few feet of vegetable oil on the surface. He demanded notification before site visits from the authorities and routinely swapped products secretly between tanks. Eventually, De Angelis would look to the soybean futures market to fulfill his supply needs. This was the beginning of the end.

In 1963, a failed deal with the Soviet Union led to a sell-off for physical commodities. Inspectors demanded to know what was going on. The chaos that ensued was out of a movie. American Express, Wall Street firms, and agribusiness giants all came to claim their inventory.

Bunge was the first to discover that most of their own were not even there. The ease with which De Angelis had duped inspectors and counterparties was comical. The tank farm held less than 10% of the 1.8 billion pounds of oil warehoused on paper. The company filed for bankruptcy less than a month later.

American Express was expected to declare bankruptcy when the stock fell by half, and lawsuits amounted to over $200 million. A small investor from Omaha would put up one-third of his firm's capital to help bail out the struggling company. Years later, everyone understood the heights this investment propelled the great Warren Buffet.

Adding to the lore was that De Angelis would be sentenced to 20 years in jail after pleading guilty, sharing a cell with the famous Jimmy Hoffa. After 15 years in prison, he would return to the meatpacking industry, committing similar crimes several more times. He died in 2009 at the age of 93.

No one really knows how much money he made in his life or how many crimes he committed. Estimates suggest the soybean oil heist alone was worth over $1 billion in today‚Äôs dollars.",15,1687461288.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/14gc5mb/the_salad_oil_king_the_greatest_agriculture_heist/

Since becoming a farmer without any experience isn't easy, this guide will help you come clean and understand the basic steps you need to take to do so.

&#x200B;

First of all, it is important to understand what farmers do in the first place.

## [What does a farmer do?](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/How-to-start-a-farming-business-Step-By-Step-Guide.html)

Farmers are all people who work in the primary sector and keep living organisms either for the production of food or raw materials (e.g. cotton) and thus generate an income. Farmers are closely connected to nature and spend most of their time out in the fields, either cultivating crops or raising animals. 

Today, however, this is only partially true. Modern greenhouse operators, for example, often spend the whole day indoors in their plants. Farmers usually do not have fixed working hours. Because they are dealing with living organisms, their schedule often gets thrown upside down. It's not that easy to have a structured work schedule. Some of them don't even have holidays or days off. To be successful in farming

## Step 1: Decide what to grow and in which field - Can I make a profit?

### Choosing the right crop

&#x200B;

First of all, you need to decide what you want to grow. Even if this sounds easy at first, it is the most complicated decision. The type of crop (or livestock) you choose is perhaps the most important decision you will make. Depending on the type of production, we divide agriculture into the following categories:

### Farming

Arboriculture (commercial cultivation of fruit trees), vegetable and fruit cultivation, timber production, biomass production, grain cultivation, green forage cultivation, herb cultivation, viticulture (grape cultivation), berry cultivation, special crops such as cotton, etc. Most of these crops are grown outdoors. 

However, some can also be grown indoors (greenhouses) using soil or air/water as a substrate.

### Animal husbandry

Farmers keep animals here mainly for their milk, meat, or eggs. Some examples of this are cows, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry (chickens, ducks, etc.). Some authorities do not consider poultry farming as livestock but as a separate category.",14,1647112573.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/tcoln7/how_to_start_a_farming_business_step_by_step_guide/

[Underground Vertical Farming Facility by NextOn in South Korea](https://preview.redd.it/107uusjubie51.jpg?width=5786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3069b81c28d35bcaccf8cd6f9c34bed134bb1dbf)

So, this is less of a 'post' and more just me being curious and having a somewhat specific question.

I am aware that there are a few downsides to indoor farming, especially under artificial light. Initial construction and ongoing operation/energy costs probably being the most notable. But let‚Äôs ignore that for now and assume they are non-issues at some point in the future.

I was wondering just how much more efficient this type of farming could be on average in terms of crop yield per cubic meter in comparison to the yield per square meter of traditional farming. Obviously different crops will benefit differently from verticality and I don‚Äôt expect any highly accurate numbers from mere estimates so an average between a few of the most grown crops would make a good enough rough approximation to satisfy my curiosity.

Assuming we‚Äôre talking about some time in the future where this is actually viable through automation and cheaper energy, and lab-grown meat could quite possibly have become commonplace, we can probably even ignore corn used for fodder which as far as I am aware makes up quite a large part of the crops we grow today. I just got curious about how much we could improve our food output through more efficient use of space and optimal growing conditions. But no amount of google-fu got me any actual percentage of what yield increase might be expected for food crops on average - except for a few very specific plants, cherrypicked because they‚Äôre more or less ideal for it. And even then actual numbers or just estimates are difficult or impossible to find.

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here can even help me with this as I doubt many would hypothesize about this kind of stuff, let alone try to get some numbers on it, but I guess it‚Äôs worth a shot and asking is free.",8,1596342075.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/i264np/indoor_vertical_farming_under_artificial_light/
agriculture,Meat,The Art and Science of Agriculture,"&#x200B;

[ The Art and Science of Agriculture ](https://preview.redd.it/lsm93ufz7kn81.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=209b63ee684f9fdd2b52467b9a97b6c52dd3721e)

 

Agriculture is the art and science of plowing, cultivating the land, and taking care of animals. This includes the preparation of plant and animal products for human consumption and their distribution in markets.

Agriculture provides most of the world‚Äôs food and textiles. Cotton, wool, and leather are agricultural products. Agriculture also provides timber for construction and paper products.

These products and the cultivation methods used may vary between continents.

## [Start of Farming](https://digiworldofagriculture.blogspot.com/2022/03/The-Art-and-Science-of-Agriculture.html)

Over the centuries, the development of agriculture has contributed to the emergence of civilizations.

Before agriculture spread, people spent most of their lives finding food, hunting wild animals, and collecting wild plants. About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned to grow cereals and root crops and adapted them to rural life.

2000 years ago, most of the world‚Äôs population depended on agriculture. Scientists do not know why these changes are happening in agriculture, but they may be a result of climate change.

When the people began to farm, they also began to raise wild animals. Domestication is the adaptation of wild plants and animals to humans.

Perhaps the first crop to be cultivated was rice or corn. It was built by Chinese farmers in 7500 BCE

The first pets were dogs used in hunting. Sheep and goats are likely to be cared for later. People also take care of cattle and pigs. Many of these animals were once hunted for meat and meat. There are now many sources of milk, cheese, and butter. After all, people use pets like bulls for plowing, transportation, and transportation.

Agriculture allowed people to produce excess food. If the harvest fails, they can use this surplus food or replace it with other goods. Overeating allows people to do other non-agricultural work.

Agriculture kept nomads close to their farms and led to the development of permanent villages. It's about trade. New economies have been successful in some areas as cities have grown and cultures have grown. The first civilizations based on intensive agriculture appeared in Mesopotamia (now Iraq and Iran) near the rivers Tigris and Euphrates and along the Nile in Egypt.

### Advanced Technologies

For millennia, the development of rural areas has been very slow. The fire was one of the first agricultural implements. Native Americans used fire to control the growth of fruit plants that they knew would grow quickly after a massive fire. Farmers plowed small fields by hand, cut down trees with axes, and dug firewood to break up and cover the soil. Over time, advanced agricultural equipment made of bone, stone, copper, and iron was developed. New methods of storage have been developed. People began collecting food in pots and pits lined with clay to use during the famine. They have also started making pots and other containers for transportation and cooking.

About 5500 BC In the third century BC. BC. Farmers in Mesopotamia developed simple irrigation systems. By diverting water from streams to their farms, farmers are living in areas that were previously unsuitable for agriculture. In Mesopotamia and later in Egypt and China, people organized and worked together to build and maintain better irrigation systems.

Early farmers also developed advanced types of crops. For example, about 6000 B.C. New grain in South Asia and Egypt. It is stronger than previous flakes. The crusts are easier to remove and can be baked into bread.

As the Romans expanded their empires, they adopted the best agricultural practices from the people they conquered. They wrote manuals on agricultural activities in Africa and Asia and adapted them for Europe.

The Chinese also adapted agricultural equipment and methods from neighboring empires. The rice variety from Vietnam matures quickly, allowing farmers to harvest multiple crops in one planting season. This rice quickly became popular throughout China.",7,1647355548.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/teqmjf/the_art_and_science_of_agriculture/

agriculture,Meat,Questions Regarding the Feasibility of Replacing Animal-Products with Plant Based Alternatives.,"There is a great deal of interest, from many groups, in advocating for the consumption of far fewer animal products (or none at all) for reasons ranging from environmental concerns (livestock as a source of pollution and greenhouse gas), to health concerns (many dieticians/nutritionists/health professionals believe we eat too much meat on average), to ethical concerns (the vegan position), to economic arguments suggesting we could save money all the while, and more.

I'm not an expert in any way when it comes to agriculture, but I have had a keen interest in doing as much research as possible on this subject. I've been quite disturbed to find that very few groups are actually performing feasibility studies of any kind; the majority of articles (of any kind) suggesting a radical change in agricultural practices do not penetrate the complexity of agricultural systems whatsoever. They make arguments like ""Field corn could just be eaten by humans instead of being fed to cows, and if not we could use that same land for more nutritious crops"". They cite broad numbers that are convincing to the uninitiated, but they roundly have no sweet clue how to give their proposals a sanity test/reality check.

So here I am, hoping to get some information from people with real world experience in the agri-industry...

I have learned that field corn is a very robust crop which often grows on land that will not sustain many other varieties. I've also learned that field corn is easily harvested, transported, and stored/silo'd (can be stored dry/requires no refrigeration). On-top of that, field corn isn't very nutritious, and can be processed into high-glucose-fructose corn syrup, which is perhaps the opposite of nutritious...

**Given these issues (with field corn alone), how feasible would it be to convert the land currently used for field/feed corn into land suitable for fruits and typical produce vegetables (the kinds required by a meat free diet)?**

**Furthermore, what impact would such a massive change have on the cost ease of harvesting, transporting, and storing a nationally adequate diet?**

**Since field corn can be easily stored in silos, giving us a steady year-round supply of it, how would crop** ***seasonality*** **affect our ability to meet national dietary requirements after such a change?**

**Regarding livestock which is raised on rough forage (land utterly unusable for corps) in more traditional farming styles, is it actually economical? (can farmers turn a profit without subsidy?) In other words, would the loss of livestock on such farms cause them problems? (such as loss of fertilizer and source of profit).**

I have a lot more questions relating to the need for fertilizer (and the environmental impact comparisons between natural and synthetic fertilizer), and some additional questions pertaining to crop decision making (how to decide what to plant), the *nutritional* feasibility of a feed-corn/bean heavy diet, more questions relating to food distribution networks, and more questions relating to the usefulness of animal by-products, but they're perhaps too numerous to burden this post with.

I do believe that as a society we should eat less meat, and I also believe that, ethically, factory-style farming is too horrendous to be worth it. I want the world, and us, to be healthier, more efficient, and to harm fewer animals, but I don't see a clear path toward the immediate achievement of this. In a world where healthy alternatives are already sold at a premium, advocates are claiming that switching to plants-only would be cheaper and healthier overall, and that the environment can be saved in the process. It just seems too good to be true; that they're screaming fruitlessly from the rooftops instead of actually answering the technical and logistical dilemmas of how to achieve their (our) goals.

When it comes to pigs, China is the world's only superpower. However, the Chinese pork industry is under severe threat. A hemorrhagic fever known as African Swine Fever has been decimating herds across Eurasia. Starting from August of 2018, the epidemic struck China [hard](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-pig/chinas-pig-herd-may-shrink-by-50-due-to-african-swine-fever-rabobank-idUSKCN1UP068), with some reports suggesting half of China's pigs will be dead by the end of 2019. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing the rise of China's pork industry, China's struggles in containing African Swine Fever, and the repercussions of this epidemic on the world.

Pigs have been domesticated in China for [approximately ](http://blogs.nature.com/freeassociation/2015/01/on-the-history-of-pigs.html)10,000 years, and has long been the meat of choice for Chinese people. Production methods, at the beginning of the reform era, were simple with small farmers raising a small number of pigs off of waste from the farm. Overall levels of production were low, with total production less than one fifth of what it is today. As China's economy grew rapidly after 1978, the pork industry had to adapt to meet rising demand. The removal of restrictions of farmers activities in the 1980s, the removal of tariffs on imported feed in the 1990s helped small farmers rapidly expand their output. Since the 2000s, government encouraged the creation of giant concentrated agribusiness in order to make meat more traceable and hygeinice standards easier to maintain The average hog farm grew from 945 pigs per farm in 942 to 8,389 in 2009. The Chinese government has encouraged domestic pig farms to expand internationally, with Shuanghui purchasing America's [largest ](https://www.iatp.org/blog/201309/food-and-national-security-the-shuanghui-smithfield-merger-revisited)pork processor in 2013.

As impressive as this growth has been, it is threatened by the rise of African Swine Fever. African Swine Fever is a hemorrhagic fever that can easily spread from pig to pig, whether through feed contaminated with disease, or from close contact between pigs. There is no vaccine or cure for African Swine Fever, although it poses no risk to humans. African Swine Fever kills nearly all pigs infected, and it is expected that half of all Chinese pigs, approximately 220 million pigs, will die or be culled by the [end ](https://www.hoosieragtoday.com/rabobank-african-swine-fever-halve-china-hog-herd/)of 2019. China has instituted a wide array of measures to control African Swine Fever, including checkpoints whenever pigs cross provincial [borders](https://whtc.com/news/articles/2018/nov/23/china-worries-about-hog-supply-as-african-swine-fever-reaches-beijing/), and increased [testing ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/slaughterhouse-test-blitz-ordered-to-stem-china-s-pig-contagion)for swine flu at slaughterhouses, and sales for disinfectant have [soared](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3018782/swine-fever-fight-forces-clean-chinas-pig-farms). The practice of feeding pigs farm waste products, often including contaminated meat, has been banned given that [swill ](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/2019/Situation_update_2019_05_16.html)feeding was at fault in 62% of outbreaks.

So far in this podcast episode, I have discussed the rise of China's pork industry, the effects of the African Swine Flue on pig production, and the impact of the epidemic on the local and global economies. The African Swine Fever makes it clear, the central role of China in the global economy. A pig epidemic impacts farmers from Benin to Argentina, and is watched by financial analysts around the world. It also makes clear the importance of global cooperation in fighting disease epidemics. The African Swine Fever started from contaminated feed going from Africa to the caucuses mountains, and is continuing to spread [through ](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/06/20/african-swine-fever-spreads-to-south-east-asia)South East Asia. Fighting African Swine Fever, and other more dangerous diseases, will require international cooperation to control and monitor disease flows.

agriculture,Meat,Why are GMO's bad?,"I know that they pose potential health risk and around the world people have allergic reactions to them, but these are minuscule problems. What are the real downsides of GMO's? I know that despite popular belief, they aren't really worse for the environment. I found out from 71 studies compiled by Oxford showed that the environmental impacts of organic farming are about the same as conventional farming.

I also found a Stanford study that said organic foods is no more nutritious.

agriculture,Meat,Went to the National Weatern Stock show in Denver today and talked to a cattle rancher. I have a few follow up questions I'm having a difficult time finding answers too.,"So the guy had a ranch with around 500 Piedmontese cows. He said this specific breed is superior to Angus because the beef is leaner, and there is more meat on them and ranchers are  simply too hard headed to switch over. When I went home and researched it, it appears the guy wasn't boasting as much as I thought.


He said that most cattle in America is Angus and ranchers are resistant to switching over to Piedmontese because Angus has been their family breed for generations so they're stubbornly stuck with them. 


Is that true? Are there more reasons ranchers don't raise Piedmontese othan they've been perfecting their specific breed of Angus over family generations and they don't want to switch?",4,1421639607.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/2swe5m/went_to_the_national_weatern_stock_show_in_denver/

agriculture,Meat,ALL fertilisers from kelp?,"Hi all,
there are proposals to employ millions of Americans to grow vast kelp farms providing all the world's protein needs in kelp itself (in various ice-creams, salads, dried snacks, etc) and in shellfish and oysters and of course an ecosystem based approach that increases actual fish supplies in the oceans. It's win win, in that kelp soaks up nutrient pollution that causes dead zones *and* can be stacked with oyster and other shellfish growing. About 2% of the world's oceans have enough nutrients to grow kelp, but the area required to actually feed the world is far less. This youtube is great and provides some images to illustrate the 3D column multi-crop system he is using. (He has open-sourced his farming methods to help Americans get into this career).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ViaskDSeI

But the area required to feed the world is vastly smaller than 2% of the world's oceans. (The oceans are 361.9 million km2, and 2% of that is 7.2 MILLION km2). Instead:-

>Seaweed farms alone have the capacity to grow massive amounts of nutrient-rich food. Professor Ronald Osinga at Wageningen University in the Netherlands has calculated that a global network of ""sea-vegetable"" farms totaling 180,000 square kilometers -- roughly the size of Washington state -- could provide enough protein for the entire world population.

>The goal, according to chef Dan Barber -- named one of the world's most influential people by Time and a hero of the organic food movement -- is to create a world where ""farms restore instead of deplete"" and allow ""every community to feed itself.""

>But here is the real kicker: Because they require no fresh water, no deforestation, and no fertilizer -- all significant downsides to land-based farming -- these ocean farms promise to be more sustainable than even the most environmentally-sensitive traditional farms.
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/the-coming-green-wave-ocean-farming-to-fight-climate-change/248750/

The video explains that kelp can also provide all the NPK we need to fertilise our traditional cereal crops. Not only that, I'm currently investigating whether kelp farming could also act as a biomass feedstock for the vat-grown meats that are starting to come down in price and will soon be competitive with normal meat from animals.
http://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/02/lab-grown-meat-prices-have-dropped.html

Kelp could also be biocharred to help improve soil quality, which would reduce the water and nutrients required to grow our crops. The bottom line? Could kelp be the silver bullet that will fertilise all our agricultural needs and replace all our grazing needs? Could kelp give us all the seafood and wheat and rice and lamb and chicken and beef and turkey that the world could ever want, while also returning all the grazing land back to nature? (Which is a third of the non-ice surface of the earth back!) Could kelp be the silver bullet to feed the world?

The idea behind the mushrooms was there was too much pork meat or that the mushrooms would be a more efficient nutrient source.

My friend originally read about this National Geographic or some other science magazine about ten years ago.

Alternatively, any info on the subject would be helpful. I'm also looking at using waste food generated by restaurants to grow mushrooms on. I found some info on that, but more is always welcome.

agriculture,Meat,Eating Injured Chickens,"There is nothing better than a good home made chicken soup. The taste can't be beat and the idea of stretching a good sized chicken out over a week of meals for a family of four gives me a warm fuzzy feeling of goodness. 

But last night I noticed something about the chicken I bought that may or may not be an issue. My wife has recently started working again so more of the shopping and cooking has come to my side of the relationship. At the store there was a choice between ""Locally Grown"" vs. ""Grain Fed"". The local grown was about 20% more expensive so I bought ""Grain Fed"" with the presumption that it was raised and processed in a large facility and shipped to supplement the locally grown food supply.

I'm no expert in forensic analysis of chicken carcases... however after our roast chicken dinner, while picking the remaining meat in preparing the carcase for boiling I noticed that the backbone appeared bent and splintered, there also appeared to be some healing that had occurred with lumpy build ups of bone around the splinter. The meat around this location was more of a brownish colour to about 3/4"" deep. My conclusion is that this chicken suffered an injury but continued to live for some time before finally being slaughtered.

Normally we buy local, or eat our own chickens. We have a wonderfully run, clean local processing facility that slaughter and dress the birds for a small fee. I have observed their process and they are doing it right. But just the same, injuries happen, I had one chicken that suffered a broken leg by an overzealous 13 year old neighbour who was left in charge of our flock. Although the chicken was still limping around, I decided that we should eat it and we did. But we removed and discarded the bruised meat from the broken leg.

Industrial agriculture may be necessary considering the present state of the world, and a good bulk of my experience and income has been from involvement in industry. I'm quite aware of how these facilities operate, the good and the bad.

My simple question is: Are there any ill effects from eating chicken meat from an injured chicken?

There is a more difficult question here. Why are so many individuals who are involved in agriculture, reluctant to consume the very products that are produced by these huge facilities?
