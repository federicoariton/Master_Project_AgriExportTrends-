"5.1","Statistical presentation","Data description","Values of agricultural production are calculated based on production data of primary commodities from Production domain and producer prices from Prices domain. The livestock value of production is measured in terms of indigenous meat."
"5.2","Statistical presentation","Sector coverage","See metadata of Production and Price domains respectively."
"5.3","Statistical presentation","Statistical concepts and definitions","The indigenous meat production is derived from meat production as follows: production from slaughtered animals plus the meat equivalent of all animals exported alive minus the meat equivalent of all animals imported alive."
"5.4","Statistical presentation","Reference area","All countries of the world – with some minor exceptions – and geographical aggregates according to the United Nations M-49 list.Notes on geographical coverage:(1) Agricultural production data of Iraq do not include Kurdistan region . (2) Since 2007 France agricultural production data include French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Reunion territories but they exclude French Polynesia and New Caledonia territories.(3)Information provided by the Russian Federation includes statistical data for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation and is presented without prejudice to relevant UN General Assembly and UN Security Council resolutions, including UN General Assembly resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 and UN Security Council resolution 2202 (2015) of 17 February 2015, which reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

"8.1","Institutional mandate","Legal acts and other agreements","Article I of the FAO Constitution requires that the Organization collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term agriculture and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture). The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time."

The objectives of these users vary, but agricultural production statistics are especially useful for market management/monitoring, production forecasts and policy-making in agriculture and food. FAO is not aware of unmet needs. Users are encouraged to contact the dataset owner for resolving more specific queries that are not addressed elsewhere in these metadata."
