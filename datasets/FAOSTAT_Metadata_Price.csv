"5.1","Statistical presentation","Data description","This sub-domain contains data on Agriculture Producer Prices and Producer Price Index. Agriculture Producer Prices are prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate). Annual data are provided from 1991, while mothly data from January 2010 for 180 country and 212 products.Producer Price Index is the index of agricultural producer prices that measures the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). The three categories of producer price index available in FAOSTAT comprise: single-item price index, commodity group index and the agriculture producer price index."

"5.3","Statistical presentation","Statistical concepts and definitions","Agricultural Producer Prices are prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate). Due to differences in data collection infrastructure and capacity, some countries do vary from this concept by collecting, instead, wholesale or local market prices. While these may be good proxies of farm-gate prices when the marketing chain is very limited, they tend to be poorer proxies in economies where transport and commercial margins constitute a significant share of the final product price. At the far extreme, some countries report retail prices, which are typically very poor proxies for producer prices.Producer Price Index is compiled using FAOSTAT price and production data and are based on average 2014-2016 = 100."

"8.1","Institutional mandate","Legal acts and other agreements","Article I of the FAO constitution requires the Organization to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term “agriculture” and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture). The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: “If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients.""Request by the Statistical Commission during its first session in 1947, and is in agreement with the resolution 48/223 C of the UN General Assembly, which mandates the Committee on Contributions to prepare the Scale of Assessment for UN Member States on the basis of the most recent reliable and verifiable available data on national accounts of as many countries and areas as possible, and that these data be published and disseminated regularly."

"13.3","Relevance","Completeness","The dataset covers approximately 180 countries out of 185 questionnaire recipients, 30 of which replied once or twice only. Countries that do not provide any basic price data are not included in the Price dataset. Producer Price Index are compiled for official and imputed data."
"14.1","Accuracy and reliability","Overall accuracy","The accuracy depends upon the definition of the items at the national level and different varieties that might be associated with specific products, as communicated by member countries through questionnaires. Accuracy of imputed values depends on the type of imputation method employed and on the quality of source data. The indices accuracy depend on the quality of basic and imputed data."

"15.1","Timeliness and punctuality","Timeliness","Production time of the annual dataset is approximately 6 months (from issuing the questionnaire to data release). This time lag is necessary for data validation, imputation and dissemination.Compililation of Producer Price Index is made after the annual producer price dataset has been validated."
"15.2","Timeliness and punctuality","Punctuality","Price and Price Index data is released in December every year. To shorten the gap between the reference year and the release date, indices for time t are forecasted using exponential smoothing methodology."
"16.1","Coherence and Comparability","Comparability – geographical","Lack of comparability has several possible causes: different price concept adopted by the countries, different varieties under the same commodity definition, different country coverage."
"16.2","Coherence and Comparability","Comparability - over time","Comparability over time varies across countries. For Price data, it occurs in particular when countries supplying agency changes or when countries respond to the annual questionnaire after an interval and time series display a price change that is not consistent with other price indicators or item coverage differs from the previous one. The first action is to request further information to the country. When possible, missing terms of the series are interpolated. In extreme cases, the new series is rejected or the old series masked. In other cases a country note informs users of the break in the series.Comparability of Price Indeces depends on the realiability of basic Prices."
"16.3","Coherence and Comparability","Coherence","Coherence - cross domain: The FAOSTAT producer price domain is not always completely coherent with the Producer Prices data disseminated in CountrySTAT for several reasons: different unit of measure, different price concept, and different agencies sourcing the data.The FAOSTAT producer price index is not integrated to other domains at present and therefore coherence is not easily assessed. | Coherence - internal: The compilation of Index data is based on available producer prices and production data is however used as a tool to assess the dataset coherence with other price indicators."

"17.1","Statistical process","Source data","The main source is official statistics from FAO member countries.  Most countries report annual prices from surveys, in some cases administered prices are provided. The questionnaire metadata section requests information on the type of source and data collection frequency. No information is requested, and therefore available, on sample sizes at country level."

"17.4","Statistical process","Data validation","A first check on completeness and consistency is run as soon as the questionnaires arrive. Information requests are sent to countries. An IT routine compares the old and the new questionnaire data and spots extreme variations. Several routines to spot outliers by comparing countries in the same region or commodities within a group are run before and after the imputation of missing data. Ultimately, the PPI provides the basis for an ultimate check before validation.Index data is validated after the validation of basic producer prices and it is validated against the trends of correlated indicator and/or data."
"17.5","Statistical process","Data compilation","Imputations are made according to FAO Statistical Standard. Four broad classes based on the type of information used: semi-official or non-official sources, auxiliary variables, technical conversion factors and imputation based on statistical and econometric techniques.Price Index is computed by using Laspeyres' formula up to t-1 and is forecasted to t by the means exponential smoothing technique, specifically the Holt-Winter approach."

"18.2","Quality management","Quality assessment","Data quality is uneven across countries. The geographical coverage is incomplete for many items. Uncertainty of and unharmonized price concept adopted by the countries and the point of transaction used to record prices may reduce the overall quality of the Price dataset."
