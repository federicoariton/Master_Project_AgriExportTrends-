"5.2","Statistical presentation","Coverage","FAO strives to provide data for all countries and crops and livestock commodities in terms of production (primary and processed), harvested areas, and live and slaughtered animal numbers."
"5.3","Statistical presentation","Sector coverage","Crops and  livestock, primary and selected derived commodities."
"5.4","Statistical presentation","Statistical concepts and definitions","1. CROPS PRIMARY: Areas refer to the area under cultivation. Area under cultivation means the area that corresponds to the total sown area, but after the harvest it excludes ruined areas (e.g. due to natural disasters).  If the same land parcel is used twice in the same year, the area of this parcel can be counted twice. Production means the harvested production. Harvested production means production including on-holding losses and wastage, quantities consumed directly on the farm and marketed quantities, indicated in units of basic product weight. Yield means the harvested production per ha for the area under cultivation. 2. CROPS PROCESSED: Production quantities in tonnes of processed crops. 3. LIVE ANIMALS: Stocks in number for Beehives and in heads or 1000 heads for other live animals. Aggregates are the sum of available data. Aggregates include estimated data. For some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals. 4. LIVESTOCK PRIMARY: Producing Animals/Slaughtered; Yield and Production Quantity. The unit of measure for these variables are as per the following items: ""Slaughtering"" is measured through activity of slaughterhouses, e.g. production of marketable meat for human consumption. Estimates of ‘other slaughtering’ can be added for a more accurate picture of meat production. ""Livestock"" is accounted for by categories that capture their rearing, either for fattening then slaughter, or for herd renewal, e.g. for breeding and/or milking. Aggregates are the sum of available data. Aggregates include estimated data. For some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals.  5. LIVESTOCK PROCESSED: Production quantity of processed commodities from livestock. Aggregates are the sum of available data. Aggregates include estimated data. For some item aggregates, conversion factors are applied to values when calculating totals."

"13.1","Relevance","User needs","The main users are FAO analysts, other international organizations, ministries and government agencies, agro-industry, trade and professional associations, research institutes and universities, journalists and the general public. The objectives of these users vary, but agricultural production statistics are especially useful for market management/monitoring, production forecasts and policy-making in agriculture and food. FAO is not aware of unmet needs. Users are encouraged to contact the dataset owner for resolving more specific queries that are not addressed elsewhere in these metadata."
"13.2","Relevance","User satisfaction","The latest quality review, the FAOSTAT User Consultation, took place during April-December 2018. Details on the survey methodology and results are available at https://www.fao.org/3/ca7239en/ca7239en.pdf"
"13.3","Relevance","Completeness","The availability of official data reported by countries varies widely. Some countries provide minimal or no data, while others report only on major commodities. Consequently, official data for specific product categories or regions may be incomplete. To create a comprehensive global production dataset, a significant number of data points are imputed. More details on imputation rates and frequencies can be found in Section 20 of these metadata."
"14.1","Accuracy and reliability","Overall accuracy","It is not possible to assess the overall accuracy of the dataset, as the source data is largely collected by member countries. For data that is imputed (including for non-reporting countries or for products for which countries do not collect official data), the accuracy of the imputations is unknown. However, imputation processes are assessed and adjusted on a regular basis."

"15.2","Timeliness and punctuality","Punctuality","The release is according to the shedule"
"16.1","Coherence and Comparability","Comparability – geographical","There is limited geographical comparability due to differences between countries in methods and coverage, except for regions where countries are bound by regulations mandating harmonized methods, such as EU countries."
"16.2","Coherence and Comparability","Comparability - over time","For shorter time periods, reasonably good comparability over time can be expected, as there is stability in the product definition and classification. However, as the time series are very long (from 1961) full comparability over time cannot be expected.1.Myanmar revised its livestock production data in line with the 2018 National Livestock Baseline Survey. The data are currently revised from the year 2018.2.Bosnia and Herzegovina revised its raw milk of sheep production data due to the new data collection method. The data are currently revised from the year 2021.3.Kazakhstan revised its livestock production data and potato and onion dry production data due to the new data collection method. The data are currently revised from the year 2019.4.India - the data on Tangerines, mandarins, clementines (CPC code 01324) are split from the data on Oranges (CPC code 01323) starting from year 2011;5.Sri Lanka - Meat of sheep, fresh or chilled data (CPC code 21115), considering the low national production of this product, have been aggregated to Meat of goat, fresh or chilled (CPC code 21116).6.Egypt revised its livestock  production data due to the new data collection method. The data are currently revised from the year 2019"
"16.3","Coherence and Comparability","Coherence","Common product classifications (CPC) help to ensure cross-domain coherence. Production data in particularly are related to producer prices, land use, and trade data. Production and trade data have a high cross-domain coherence, these are used as inputs in the food balance sheets, which serves as an additional validation of the data in a single supply and utilization framework."
"16.4","Coherence and Comparability","Classification system","CPC 2.1 Extended and FAO Commodity List  (FCL) - which is an internal FAO classification system"
"17.1","Statistical process","Source data","The main data source is official statistics from FAO member countries. The source data can originate from surveys, administrative data and estimates based on expert observations. Which type of source is used by countries can significantly affect reliability and comparability of data. In nearly all cases where countries provide their official production data, data are recorded as reported by countries. The only exceptions are the application of conversion factors (e.g., if a country reports rice production on a husked rice basis, that production must be converted to a paddy basis), or cases of reporting errors (typically digit errors). In instances where no official data is available, data from unofficial sources (as specialized international commodity institutes i.e. Oil World, USDA etc.) may be used. If no data from either official or unofficial sources is available, data are imputed. In all cases, data are flagged accordingly."
"17.2","Statistical process","Frequency of data collection and acquisition","Yearly"
"17.3","Statistical process","Data collection method","FAO data collection is carried out by a country correspondents in the Member States. The collection run either through annual production questionnaires (APQ) distributed to countries, from national publications (Yearbooks and Pocketbooks) or from official country websites."
"17.4","Statistical process","Data validation","Countries are responsible for transmitting data which have already been checked. Validation at FAO concerns any transmission errors and data consistency checks, as well as outlier detection. Other validations concerns assessing how far the current value is from the earlier data, consistency of totals and partial components and correspondence between variables from different data sets, e.g. between milk production and live animals producing milk."
"17.5","Statistical process","Data compilation","Calculation of item group aggregates; calculation of country groups aggregates"
"17.6","Statistical process","Regional aggregation","The aggregates are calculated at the end of a statistical process. The total amount for a group of units (or all the units) is obtained by summing up the observed values. Yield for the aggregated group is  comptuted as a ratio of the total output to the total input. For example, the global wheat yield corresponds to the global wheat production divided by the global area harvested."
"17.7","Statistical process","Adjustment","The country correspondents are responsible for the data quality. FAO validates and enventually corrects the country data in consultation with them."
"17.8","Statistical process","Imputation","FAO imputation methods are used to impute missing production data since  1991 (Ensemble imputation model for crops and meat data; Hierarchical Linear Model for milk and hen egg  data). Since 2010 production data of the derived commodities are imputed in the framework of the Food Balance Sheet compilation in accordance with the FBS new methodology.The EU member country production data for the primary commodities are obtained from EUROSTAT (with some minor exceptions) from the year 2018. If official EU data are missing in the production domain, then estimates are generated for the aggregates and within the framework of the Food Balances for the calculation of the food availability."
"18.1","Quality management","Quality assurance","FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes used to compile the published datasets. The FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF), available at: https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/01debb18-63b2-403b-87fe-0eca5409656e,  provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO’s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SDQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried"
"18.2","Quality management","Quality assessment","According to the 2023 Quality Assessment and Planning Survey (QAPS) , This data domain reported a quality score of 0.78 in the 2023 Quality Assessment and Planning Survey (QAPS). According to the QAPS a statistical output is considered of good quality when it reaches a quality score of 0.6 or above."
