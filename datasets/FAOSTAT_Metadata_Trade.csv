"5.1","Statistical presentation","Data description","The food and agricultural trade dataset is collected, processed and disseminated by FAO according to the standard International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS) Methodology. The data is mainly provided by UNSD, Eurostat, and other national authorities as needed. This source data is checked for outliers, trade partner data is used for non-reporting countries or missing cells, and data on food aid is added to take into account total cross-border trade flows. The trade database includes the following variables: export quantity, export value, import quantity, and import value. The trade database includes all food and agricultural products imported/exported annually by all the countries in the world."
"5.2","Statistical presentation","Coverage",""
"5.3","Statistical presentation","Sector coverage","The dataset contains all food and agricultural products imported and exported during the reference year by country. In addition to the individual country data, other item and country aggregates are disseminated. The processed trade data is essential for the compilation of Supply/Utilization Accounts (SUA) and Food Balance Sheets (FBS)."
"5.4","Statistical presentation","Statistical concepts and definitions","Quantity of food and agricultural exports: Export quantity is defined by the IMTS as the physical quantity of domestic origin or manufactured products shipped out of the country. It includes re-exports. According to the FAO methodology, the quantity of food and agricultural exports included in the FAOSTAT database is expressed in terms of weight (tonnes) for all commodities except for live animals which are expressed in units (heads); poultry, rabbits, pigeons and other birds are expressed in thousand units. As a general rule, trade quantity refers to net weight, excluding any sort of container.Value of agricultural exports: Value of agricultural exports are expressed in thousand US dollars in the FAOSTAT database. Export values are reported as FOB (free on board), that is, the value of the goods plus the value of the services performed to deliver the goods to the border of the exporting country).Quantity of food and agricultural imports: Import quantity represents the physical quantity of the products imported for domestic consumption or processing shipped into a country. It includes re-imports. According to the FAO methodology, the quantity of food and agricultural imports included in the FAOSTAT database is expressed in terms of weight (tonnes) for all commodities except for live animals which are expressed in units (heads); poultry, rabbits, pigeons and other birds are expressed in thousand units. As a general rule, trade quantity refers to net weight, excluding any sort of container. It includes also food aid quantities, where relevant.Value of agricultural imports: Value of agricultural imports are expressed in thousand US dollars in the FAOSTAT database. Import values are reported as CIF (Cost Insurance and Freight), that is, the value of the goods, plus the value of the services performed to deliver goods to the border of the exporting country, plus the value of the services performed to deliver the good from the border of the exporting country to the border of the importing country)."

"8.1","Institutional mandate","Legal acts and other agreements","Article I of FAO constitution states ""The Organization shall collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term “agriculture” and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture)"" (FAO, 2017).FAO, through its Statistics Division (ESS), is a member of the Task Force of International Merchandise Trade Statistics (TF-IMTS) coordinated by UNSD, and together with other international organizations, FAO contributes to the improvement of the IMTS methodology, as well as to its implementation at the country level. Through ESS, FAO is also a member of the Expert Group of Global Trade Statistics.FAO trade statistics follow the international standards provided by the IMTS, which is periodically revised by UNSD with the contribution of other international organizations and member countries. The original version was issued in 1970 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.70.XVII.16) and the first revised version was released in 1982 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.82.XVII.14). At its forty-first session, the Statistical Commission adopted International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Concepts And Definitions, 2010 (IMTS 2010) and endorsed the proposed implementation programme, including the preparation of the revision of International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Compilers Manual and supporting technical assistance activities (see E/2010/24, chap. I.B, decision 41/103, para. (b)). In the same decision (para. (c)), the Commission requested the Expert Group on International Merchandise Trade Statistics and the Task Force on International Merchandise Trade Statistics to continue their work, focus on the implementation of IMTS 2010 and give due consideration to national circumstances, the harmonization of national and regional compilation practices, and the conduct of related comparison studies. The legal acts concerning trade statistics at national levels are available on the country websites."
"8.2","Institutional mandate","Data acquisition and data transmission","Data sharing with respect to the trade dataset includes a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with UNSD on the implementation of IMTS and a data exchange, a mutual agreement with Eurostat on data sharing, and cooperation with WTO on accessing the CDS database in order to update the Total merchandise statistics."

"12.6","Accessibility and clarity","Documentation on methodology","The FAO trade statistics dataset is compiled according to the IMTS methodology and standards adopted by the UN Statistics Commission and implemented by UNSD. The main methodologies on trade statistics are available at: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/imts/imts_default.htm"
"13.1","Relevance","User needs","The main user of the annual trade statistics is the internal system used for the compilation of the SUA/FBS. The trade data received by FAO are also shared with the Fishery department and other FAO units. Other users include NGOs, trade and professional associations, research institutes and universities, journalists and the general public. So far, no unmet user needs have been identified."
"13.2","Relevance","User satisfaction","According to the FAOSTAT User Consultation conducted in 2018, the average percentage of fully satistified users with respect to the 5 quality dimensions considered for statistical outputs in the SDQAF (relevance, accuracy and reliability, timeliness and punctuality, consistency and comparability, accessibility and clarity) was equal to 71%. https://www.fao.org/3/ca7239en/ca7239en.pdf"
"13.3","Relevance","Completeness","Using mirror statistics and imputation, a complete trade dataset is produced and disseminated for 202 countries and territories for crop and livestock products and trade indices datasets. The detailed trade matrix dataset and the trade indicators are available only for the reporter countries, which is around 75% of total number of countries and territories. Not all values, however, are official. Imputed or estimated values are flagged as such."
"14.1","Accuracy and reliability","Overall accuracy","The main source of errors is the deviation from the standard IMTS methodology and recommendations in reporting annual trade data by various countries. Incomplete country metadata is another source of errors, especially related to the description of the unit of measurement used at the most detailed level of reported data. Trade data accuracy is affected by specific characteristics such as the practice of concealing confidential information and the exemption thresholds applied by countries in order to reduce the burden on enterprises. The lack of country tariff line description generate various ambiguities on the link between HS and FCL."
"14.2","Accuracy and reliability","Model assumption error","No statistical model is used for the estimation of a variable, except that applying basic global averages to calculate missing quantities and animal weight when the monetary value and animals heads are given, respectively."
"14.3","Accuracy and reliability","Imputation indicators","According to the annual FAO trade monitoring system about 75% of the total merchandise trade statistics is officially reported by countries. For missing data, the imputation methods (including mirror data and quantity calculations based on unit values) are applied."
"14.4","Accuracy and reliability","Data revision - policy","Preliminary trade data reported by certain countries are substituted by the final trade data upon its release. In some cases, the missing trade data are also updated according to the new or revised data."
"14.5","Accuracy and reliability","Data revision - practice","Usually, the revised data for n-1 to n-5 is included in the global validation of the trade data; cross-checking with other trade data bases is also used to update the trade statistics in the last 5 years."
"15.1","Timeliness and punctuality","Timeliness","Data are normally received 11 months after the reference year, and processed and disseminated by FAO within 2 months."
"15.2","Timeliness and punctuality","Punctuality","Trade data are normally disseminated in line with the pre-announced release calendar."
"16.1","Coherence and Comparability","Comparability – geographical","The accuracy and comparability of trade data is very much dependent on customs practices, definitions and policies in individual countries. These differences often lead to different quantities being reported by the reporting country and the trading partner. The inconsistency between the declaration of the reporter and partner countries could be generated by the trade methodology applied (general trade system versus special trade system, the latter of which is the case of extra-EU trade statistics, for example), by the classification used, or by the country coverage. Given this underlying situation, the geographical comparability of trade data depends on which countries and groups of countries are compared. For some countries, the comparability is highly consistent. The use of mirror data cross-checking in FAO's validation processes is one manner through which data comparability is evaluated."
"16.2","Coherence and Comparability","Comparability - over time","A break in the time series for a particular product could be generated by a change in the country classification (such as the splitting of Sudan into Sudan and South Sudan, or the enlargement of the EU) as well as due to the revision of the HS classification (version 2017 is currently used, but for 2022 reference year the HS 2022 will be implemented). For periods when data are compiled according to a singular HS classification, data over time are fully comparable."
"16.3","Coherence and Comparability","Coherence","Coherence - cross domain: FAO trade data are coherent with FAO production data and producer price data, as they are based on the same classifications. Apart from the International Trade Statistics, information on trade flows can be found in National Accounts, Business Statistics and Balance of Payments. The compilation of the data and the production of the above-mentioned statistics follow the recommendations (sources and methods) of different international organisations, i.e. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund (IMF), United Nations (UN), etc. The Quality Report on International Trade Statistics documents the main differences between these sources in terms of concepts and definitions, statistical unit or object, classification used, geographical breakdown, reference period and correction methods. | Coherence - internal: The internal coherence of data are generally good."
"16.4","Coherence and Comparability","Classification system","HS 2017 converted into FAO Commodity List (also known as FCL, which is a classification based on the item tree approach used for the compilation of SUA/FBS) is used for mapping HS 2017  to CPC 2.1 Expanded."
"17.1","Statistical process","Source data","The main source is official country statistics compiled by UNSD and Eurostat. Other sources include:1. INTERFAIS WFP food aid data base: This data source is used to capture the food aid data, which is sometimes excluded from commercial trade records and is thus not always included in UNSD data.2. National web databases, national and international publications to update the trade data for the non-reporting countries which are missing from COMTRADE."
"17.2","Statistical process","Frequency of data collection and acquisition","The annual trade data are downloaded once a year from UNSD, Eurostat, and other relevant sources."
"17.3","Statistical process","Data collection method","The tariff line data is retrieved through APIs provided by UNSD and EUROSTAT."
"17.4","Statistical process","Data validation","The data received at the tariff line level is aggregated into bilateral trade flows and total trade levels. Items are mapped from the HS (Harmonized System) classification to the CPC (Central Product Classification). Missing quantities are imputed using dollar values and global price trends for the specific items. Outliers are addressed using multiple techniques in compliance with the FAO Standards on Data Editing and Validation https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/6b13757e-d7d0-48ec-aa8c-1923f35eeb7a/content"
"17.5","Statistical process","Data compilation","The statistical value: International trade in goods statistics apply harmonised principles when compiling the statistical value of trade flows. In general, all goods should be valued with the total amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. The statistical value does not include taxes on export or import, such as customs duties, value added tax, excise duty, levies, export refunds or other taxes with similar effect. It includes only incidental expenses (freight, insurance) incurred, in the case of exports, in the part of the journey located on the territory of the reporting Member State and, in the case of imports, in the part of the journey located outside the territory of the reporting country. This can be characterized as an FOB value (free on board) for exports, and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports."

"18.1","Quality management","Quality assurance","Quality documentation: No quality reports or studies have been undertaken by FAO. Similarly, no national quality reports are collected. However, data are carefully reviewed and checked by FAO at least twice per year. | Quality assurance: FAO is responsible for the quality of the internal statistical processes used to compile the published datasets. The FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF), available at: https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/01debb18-63b2-403b-87fe-0eca5409656e,  provides the necessary principles, guidelines and tools to carry out quality assessments. FAO is performing an internal bi-annual survey (FAO Quality Assessment and Planning Survey) designed to gather information on all of FAO’s statistical activities, notably to assess the extent to which quality standards are being implemented with a view to increasing compliance with the quality dimensions of SDQAF, documenting best practices and prepare quality improvement plans, where necessary. Domain-specific quality assurance activities are carried out systematically (e.g. quality reviews, self-assessments, compliance monitoring)."
"18.2","Quality management","Quality assessment","According to the 2023 Quality Assessment and Planning Survey (QAPS) , This data domain reported a quality score of 0.86 in the 2023 Quality Assessment and Planning Survey (QAPS). According to the QAPS a statistical output is considered of good quality when it reaches a quality score of 0.6 or above."
"19.0","Recommended uses and limitations","Recommended uses and limitations","The statistics presented in this dataset are mapped from HS classification to CPC classification. Therefore minor data moves can be between similar items. The mirror statistics are the data derived from the other reporting countries' data. They shouldn't be accepted as countries' official declaration."
"20.0","Comment","Comment","Inclusions : The following transactions are generally included in international trade in goods statistics: Barter trade, goods on consignment, goods on financial lease, goods traded between enterprises under common ownership, goods traded on government account, and goods traded with the intent of further processing. Exclusions: The following transactions are excluded from international trade in goods statistics for conceptual or methodological reasons: Goods in simple transit, temporary trade, particular trade not subject to a commercial transaction, supply for national armed forces stationed abroad or embassies, emergency aid for disaster areas, means of payment and monetary gold, and goods for and after repair."
